0,1.1,Introduction,"IntroductionStudent Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able toIdentifymethods used by archaeologists, anthropologists, historians, and geographers to analyze evidence.[WH29A]Why study the past?Stories about ourselves are always intriguing. Where did we come from? How did people from thousands of different cultures, over tens of thousands of years, live? How were their concerns different from or similar to our own? The past is full of surprises, but they never fall far from home. By learning more about who we were — and how we came to be here — we become more fully human.Archaeologists and Their Artifacts""Archaeology is the science of rubbish."" -archaeologist Stuart PiggotTheForma Urbis Romae, or Severan Marble Plan, may just be the world's biggest jigsaw-puzzle. Carved across marble slabs 45 feet high and 60 feet long, it is a map of ancient Rome showing every street, building, room, and staircase. Eighteen-hundred years ago it hung in the Roman census bureau, the most detailed map of the city ever produced.At least, it used to be. Today it languishes in the basement of a museum, smashed. Now a team of American researchers have devised a novel way of pasting it together again — by scanning it into a computer.For hundreds of years after the fall of Rome, hunks of marble were hacked off the map for building material. Then the building housing the map collapsed. In 1562, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese made a valiant attempt to collect the surviving sections. Since then every attempt to piece together the 1,163 fragments has failed. It is one of classical archaeology's great unsolved problems.This mock-up of an archaeological dig site gives an impression of what the important elements and basic tools are. Even in this age of computers and x-rays, archaeologists still have to use basic methods like digging and measuring to ensure that they collect the best information possible.The first task of the American researchers was simple: 3-D scan each individual block into their computer. Now it gets harder. The computer must find a way to fit them together. So far the data base contains ""8 billion polygons and 6 thousand color images, occupying 40 gigabytes."" Solving the puzzle, says the team, ""will take months, possibly years.""This approach is light years away from the traditional methods of archaeologists who spend their time carefully sifting through the dirt, but today a battery of new tools is helping to bring the past back to life.Archaeology, notes one of its practitioners, ""has a long disreputable line of descent; its ancestors were, quite literally, grave robbers and adventurers."" Foremost amongst them ranks the Italian Giovanni Belzoni. In the early 1800s he looted hundreds of ancient Egyptian tombs, candidly admitting: ""The purpose of my researches was to rob the Egyptians of their papyri."" Papyri were the ancient papers of the Egyptians. They were made from a plant that grew along the Nile Valley.Modern archaeologists proceed with more caution. Still, few can claim the delicacy of Sir Leonard Woolley, who in the 1920s excavated the great Sumerian city of Ur. While digging in the royal cemetery, he noticed a small hole just below where a small gold cap and some gold nails had been found. Woolley filled the hole with liquid plaster. When the soil was cleared away, the shaft of a lyre — preserved as a plaster cast — emerged. Woolley was able to reconstruct the entire instrument, even though its original wood had long since vanished.You Want a Date?Before starting a dig the first step is to map a site, dividing it into small squares. Careful notes are kept of changes in sediment, and of each object (however fragmentary) found within each square. The idea is to create a 3-D picture of the area — a picture through time. Younger remains usually lie closer to the surface, older ones beneath. Fortunately, archaeologists no longer have to rely on position alone for judging an object's age.In the late 1940s, the physicist Willard Libby inventedC-14 or radiocarbon dating. It transformed the study of the past. For the first time organic material — charcoal, wood, shell and bone, even clothing — from 500 to 50,000 years old could be reliably dated. Through radiocarbon dating, archaeologists built a world-wide chronology of human activity.How C-14 dating worksCarbon exists in the atmosphere in two forms — ordinary carbon, C-12; and carbon-14. This is radioactive and decays with a half-life of 5730 years (it takes 5730 years for half of the C-14 in a sample to become C-12). Plants and animals contain carbon in the same mixture as the atmosphere. When they die, C-14 continues to decay. By measuring how much — or, rather, how little — C-14 remains, researchers can calculate how much time has elapsed since death occurred.There are traps, of course. An object may be contaminated by carbon from another source. Or, it may not ""belong"" at the level where the carbon-containing material was found. Perhaps it was carried there by erosion, or dislodged by a careless archaeologist. It happens. All this allows archaeologists to go on arguing about ages, for ages.How do archaeologists know where to dig? Often they don't. They know where not to dig — where nothing interesting exists. But how do you tell one from the other? Excavation is expensive, and there is nothing an archaeologist likes less than staring at an empty hole. The ideal solution is to look underground before you start. Astonishingly, techniques are coming along to do just that.Most archaeologists rely on buried buildings, bodies, ancient hearths, or iron tools, having different physical ""signatures"" from the surrounding soil. Ground penetrating radar, for example, pumps radio waves into the earth then measures the patterns reflected back. For example, by coupling his scanner to a special computer program, anthropology professor Lawrence B. Conyers has produced striking images of otherwise invisible structures. One day, he promises, he will generate moving 3-D pictures and take us on underground video ""tours"" of archaeological sites.The great English archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler used to remind his students, ""The archeologist is not digging up things, he is digging up people."" Regardless of the changes in methods, archaeological aims remain the same: to illuminate the past and bring back to life the experiences and cultures of people long gone.Anthropologists and Their PeopleFinding them didn't come as much of a surprise. Not to David Roberts, anyway. Winding its way across a 117,000-year-old former sand dune was a trail of footprints made by human feet. They are the oldest human footprints ever found.Roberts is a South African geologist. Previously, he had come across fossilized carnivore tracks in the rock fringing Langebaan Lagoon 60 miles north of Cape Town. And he had noticed rock fragments, which showed signs of human use. So: ""On a hunch, I began searching for hominid footprints — and found them!""When did it all begin? If you had asked Dr. John Lightfoot in 1644, he would have given you a precise answer. The world was created on October 23, 4004 B.C.E., promptly ""at nine o'clock in the morning."" Lightfoot, a Hebrew scholar, arrived at the date through exhaustive study of Scripture.Today we know this underestimates our planet's true age a million-fold. The earth formed 4.6 billion years ago — an almost unimaginably long time. But what of our human past? How far back does it stretch? There are several answers — a series of ""firsts"":2 million+ years: First Hominids100,000+ years: First Humans9,000 years: First Settlements6,000 years: First Civilizations[Figure 2]In 1572, scientists recovered a strange fossil: the skull of what they thought was an ancient Cyclops. This engraving was made to depict the live creature. As it turned out, the skull they found was simply from an elephant!All this and more is the province of anthropology. The word means literally ""the study of man."" We are a complicated species, and anthropologists poke into every aspect of our human nature.The Caretakers of CultureSome anthropologists live for years at a time with aboriginal peoples, recording how they organize their lives with the overlay of civilization absent. Margaret Mead, the most celebrated anthropologist of her generation, pioneered this approach in the 1920s when she lived among the Samoan Islanders of the South Pacific. She returned to tell a scandalized world that they practiced free love. Later experts have suggested her adolescent informants fooled the rather earnest young Mead. They were just leading her on.Other researchers look to our nearest surviving relatives, the great apes, and seek clues to human behavior there. For 40 years Jane Goodall has lived alongside the chimpanzees of Gombe National park in Tanzania. Chimps may look cuddly and cute, but they are not above thievery, infanticide, and murder.Who owns the past? It may sound an odd question, but it is one anthropologists, especially in North America, are having to face. American museums are filled with the skeletons of Native Americans exhumed — looted, if you like — without the permission of their living descendants. In 1990, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) ordered that this material be returned to the tribes.[Figure 3]This is the upper right third molar of an unidentified species discovered at the Aramis site in Ethiopia in 1992. The species was later namedAustralopithecus ramidusand dates back 4.4 million years.Kennewick Man is at the center of this bitter dispute. A near-complete human skeleton, it was found along the banks of the Columbia River in Kennewick, Washington, in July 1996. James C. Chatters, the forensic anthropologist who first examined it observed that its characteristics reflected European — not Native American — ancestry.To Chatters' astonishment when the skeleton was dated, it turned out to be over 9,000 years old. The story made headlines around the world — and a coalition of Indian tribes immediately sued for possession. Ever since the case has been mired in court.Kennewick Man's discovery may reveal fundamentally new facts about the earliest inhabitants of the Americas. If the tribal leaders have their way, he will be reburied at a secret site and his story lost to us all forever. What's the solution? To begin, more trusting relationships between researchers and the people they study must be forged.Historians and Their Time[Figure 4]""On the 24th of August ... between 2 and 3 in the afternoon my mother drew his attention to a cloud of unusual size and appearance...I can best describe its shape by likening it to a pine tree. It rose into the sky on a very long ""trunk"" from which spread some ""branches""...The sight of it made the scientist in my uncle determined to see it from closer at hand."" –Pliny the Younger describing his uncle's death in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, 79 C.E.There wasn't any history before 3000 B.C.E.In a literal sense that is true. Historians mostly rely on written documents to reconstruct the past. Before 3000 B.C.E. writing did not exist, as far as we know. Accordingly, events earlier than this time are referred to as ""pre-history,"" before written history!Why C.E. and B.C.E.?You may be used to seeing dates with B.C. or A.D. (for example, 2750 B.C. or A.D. 476). So why don't you see those abbreviations here?The abbreviation B.C. stands for ""Before Christ,"" and A.D. stands for the Latin phraseAnno Domini, which means, ""the Year of Our Lord."" Because history belongs to everyone, and because not everyone is a Christian, many historians have been using the new terms, B.C.E. and C.EThe abbreviation C.E. stands for the ""Common Era"" and is used in place of A.D. For example, 1492 C.E. is the same as A.D. 1492 (which is sometimes incorrectly written as 1492 A.D.). The abbreviation B.C.E. stands for ""Before the Common Era,"" and is used in place of B.C. The year 1625 B.C.E is the same as 1625 B.C.Clay and the SumeriansThe Sumerians of Mesopotamia were among the first people to develop a written language. They recorded events and religious information on wet clay tablets using styluses.Note: This picture goes to the freeNew York Timeswebsite which requires registration. Ask your parent or teacher for help.The Sumerians invented the first writing system. At first they used pictographs to represent words — little pictures drawn on wet clay. A picture of a bird represents mushen, ""bird;"" a fish, the word ha, ""fish."" Sumerian scribes quickly discovered how to write new words by joining pictures together: the signs for ""woman"" and ""mountain"" produced geme, ""slave-girl"" — the Sumerians took their slaves from the mountain tribes to the east. Eventually the pictures evolved into abstract patterns made by a wedge-shaped stylus. This is calledcuneiformwriting, from the Latin wordcuneus= ""wedge.""What did the Sumerians write? Mostly lists. Inventories of people and possessions, of goods to trade, of food rations for slaves. There are legal documents: marriage records, wills, contracts, deeds of sale — and tax returns by the score (one Sumerian proverb reads ""You can have a lord, You can have a king, But the man to fear is the tax collector""). Of the 1500,000 clay tablets recovered so far, 75 percent deal with such matters.Did they have laptop computers in 480 B.C.E.? Hardly. The youth in this image is writing on a folded tablet using a stylus (sort of like an ancient fountain pen).Scattered amongst them, though, are poems and epics — the world's first literature. There is a farmer's almanac, even recipes. This one comes from Akkad around 1700 B.C.E. It is for ""Tuhu Beets"" — beets boiled in beer (don't knock it until you've tried it), and begins: Tuhu shirum saqum izzaz me tukan lipia tanadi tusammat tabaum... Roughly, you boil beets with onions in beer, add herbs, mush everything into a porridge, then sprinkle with raw shuhutinnu . What's shuhutinnu? — ""an unidentified member of the onion family.""The Sumerians never wrote history in the sense of trying to explain how the past happened, by the deed of men and women, economic factors, natural disasters or pestilence. They believed their society had been there since the universe began, planned and decreed by the gods. It never occurred to them that their land had once been scattered villages occupying desolate marshland, its greatness coming from human toil, invention, vision and determination.Herodotus is widely credited as being the first historian. He traveled widely in the Greek world and wrote down what he saw and the stories he heard. Herodotus coined the word history, which is Greek for ""inquiries.""Credit as the first historian goes to Herodotus, born c. 484 C.E., who lived in Athens while the Parthenon was being built. He seems to have been a trader, a compulsive story-teller who traveled widely throughout the Greek empire. He must have made an enchanting companion, engaging in conversation everyone he met. ""My business is to record what people say,"" he explains, ""but I am no means bound to believe it."" Officially he wrote an account of the war between the Persians and Greeks. Along the way, he found time to be fascinated by ancient Egyptian religion, the flooding of the Nile — and gnats, on which he offers sound advice:Everyone provides himself with a net, which during the day he uses for fishing, and at night fixes up around his bed, and creeps in under it before he goes to sleep. For anyone to sleep wrapped in a cloak or linen would be useless, for the gnats would bite through them; but they do no even attempt to get through the net.""What made him the first serious historian,"" says classical scholar and poet Peter Levi, ""is his combination of great scope and precise focus, his imaginative power as a story-teller and his rationalism, his concern with truth.""Vesuvius: A Case Study in HistoryIt might not look like much, but this 316-pound rock was to the ancient Greeks what the Heisman Trophy is to a collegiate football player. The inscription reveals who won the weight lifting competition in one of the first Olympics: ""Bybon has lifted me over his head with one hand."" Did Bybon know his victory would make for some heavy history over 26 centuries later?In Roman times, Pliny-the-Younger proved a worthy successor with his brilliant description of the eruption of Vesuvius quoted above. He was just 17 years old when the volcano exploded, destroying the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. His account has helped modern volcanologists reconstruct the event. It lasted about 18 hours, Pliny tells them. There was a cloud shaped like ""a pine tree"" — a dense column of hot gas, rock and ash, tossed 20 miles up into the sky. After about 12 hours, the force of the blast slackened. The column collapsed hurtling a gigantic surge cloud of hot ash down Vesuvius' western slope at 100 mph. Within four minutes it reached Herculaneum, blasting buildings, burning or suffocating the people. A second surge devastated Pompeii.During the 1981 eruption of Mt. St. Helens, scientists were amazed at the speed and power of these so-called ""pyroclastic flows."" They overturned forests and engulfed a car speeding away at 80 mph. Pliny reports one of these surges and was fortunate not to have perished in it: ""I look back: a dense cloud looms behind us, following us like a flood poured across the land... The fire itself actually stopped some distance away, but darkness and ashes came again, a great weight of them..."" His uncle was not so lucky and died across the Gulf of Naples at Stabiae.Vesuvius will erupt again. The only question is when. Millions of people now living in the shadow of the volcano will be at risk.The philosopher George Santayana remarked: ""Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it."" Henry Ford dismissed history as ""bunk.""RalphWaldo Emerson maintained ""There is properly no history; only biography."" Percy Bysshe Shelley put it poetically: ""History is a cyclic poem written by Time upon the memories of man."" Shakespeare is briefest: ""What's past is prologue."" The future begins here.Herodotus, the first historian, claimed modest goals for his work: ""that the doings of men may not be forgotten."" On the title page he wrote Historia, Greek for ""inquiries"" or ""researches."" Inquiring into the past has been called history ever since.Geographers and Their SpaceThe desire to know how people in distant cultures live is an ancient one. Before photography, the internet, and airline travel, how did people learn about far off lands? During the Renaissance, mapmaking was the answer! An explorer would chart his path, bring home the information and hire a mapmaker to bring his memories to life.They set out on April 7, 1805, from Fort Mandan, North Dakota, near present-day Bismarck. Two young army captains, 28-year-old Merriweather Lewis and his partner William Clark, rounded up their party and headed west. They took a map showing just three points — the Mississippi as far as Mandan, the position of St. Louis, and the location of the mouth of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. It was Lewis and Clark's task to fill in the rest.""Your observations are to be taken with great pains and accuracy,"" President Thomas Jefferson instructed. ""In all your intercourse with the natives, treat them in the most friendly and conciliatory manner."" To this end, the expedition's supplies included 4,600 sewing needles, 144 small scissors, 8 brass kettles, 33 pounds of colored beads, and vermilion face paint.Traveling with Lewis and Clark were 32 men and a young Indian woman named Sacagawea. When the expedition limped into St. Louis on September 23, 1806, it had covered 8,000 miles, bringing back priceless information about the rivers and mountains of the region, as well as information about the plants, animals, and people.Based on this picture of a woman in a traditional Russian coat, do you think the weather in Russia is more tropical or wintery? Do you think it is that way all the time in Russia? How would you find out?Humans are curious creatures, always wondering what lies beyond the horizon. Lewis and Clark did not describe themselves as geographers, but theycouldhave. Geography is the study of the surface of the earth. It is about people and places. It is about the physical character of a country, its climates and landscapes, and its biological environment.Eratosthenes was the first to use the word ""Geographica"" as the title of his book in the 3rd century B.C.E. Eratosthenes figured out the size of the earth. His method was rather simple. He knew that on the summer solstice in Aswan, the sun shines directly overhead at noon. In Alexandria, 500 miles to the north, he found it cast a shadow, giving an angle of about 7.2 degrees. Assuming the sun is sufficiently distant that its rays are parallel, he calculated the earth's circumference by the ratios: 7.2/360 = 500/x. His figure of 25,000 miles was very close to reality.Mapping the WorldThe geographer's most important tool is the map. Mapmaking went through a revolution in 15th and 16th centuries when a marvelous age of exploration dawned. Bartolomeu Dias, who discovered the Cape of Good Hope in 1487, was followed by Vasco da Gama, who pioneered the route to India. In 1492, Columbus crossed the Atlantic. And in 1519, Magellan set out on his ambitious voyage to circumnavigate the planet.Magellan's venture was not a happy one. Approaching the tip of South America, his crew mutinied, terrified by ferocious weather. Magellan executed some, imprisoned others, and marooned the ringleader on a remote shore of South America. Rounding Tierra del Fuego — the southern tip of South America — Magellan headed into the Pacific. He trusted his maps and thought it would take only a few days to cross. But his trip took four months. Drinking water became putrid and turned yellow. The crew almost starved. They were reduced to eating sawdust, leather strips, and rats.As sailors returned and more information came in, more of the earth needed to be mapped. Cartographers — or mapmakers — faced a fascinating problem. How could the three-dimensional surface of the earth be represented on a two-dimensional page? They learned it could not be done without sacrificing shape, direction, or size.Have you ever been lost? How did you find your way back home? Did you ask someone, consult a map, or wander around until you recognized something?Mercator Plots the CourseIn 1569, Gerardus Mercator, a Flemish mapmaker, devised a brilliant solution and produced the earth's most famous map. On a globe, lines of longitude meet at the poles. Mercator opened them up to make them parallel, intersecting at right angles with lines of latitude. In another adjustment, he placed latitude lines farther part as they approached north and south.The map had certain drawbacks. Regions near the poles suffered gross distortions. Greenland, for example, appeared several times the size of South America. Sailors, for whom the map was prepared, did not much care. What mattered was that the map offered a simple way to plot a course.In 1585, Mercator began to publish his maps in book form. Engraved on the title page appeared the Greek god, Atlas, carrying the earth upon his back. Ever since, a book of maps has been known as an atlas.(ISN) Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentsDescribe the process archaeologists use to discover lost artifacts.Outline some of the ways anthropologists learn about society.Explain what the letters A.D., B.C., C.E., and B.C.E. mean.Explain why historians know or write so little about societies prior to 3000 B.C.Summarize the methods geographers use to study and organize information about the earth.(ISN) Discussion and Study QuestionsWhy do we study history?Why might Herodotus be considered the first world historian?How did geographers deal with issue of mapping a three-dimensional on a two-dimensional surface?Who are the various groups of experts that use history to complete their work?VocabularyQuizlet Flashcard Vocabulary for Introductionanthropologista scientist who studies artifacts in order to understand the origins, customs and beliefs of humankind.archaeologista scientist who studies past human life and culture by the recovery and examination of artifacts.artifactanything created and left behind by humans that gives information about the culture of its creator.geographera scientist who studies the earth and its features and of the distribution of life on the earth, including human life and the effects of human activity.historianone who records and interprets human events of the past.economicsthe study of the human behaviors practiced by people in order to meet their needs.eraa segment of historical time.periodizationthe division of history into periods or segments of time.Stone Agean historical era existing before humans learned to develop metal technologies, characterized by a hunting and gathering way of life.turning pointsan event marking a unique or important historical change of course.Internet ResourcesABC-CLIOprovides a database of Daily Lifes throughout the World over different periods of time.Maps 101provides collections, videos, map and other resources that can be downloaded, streamed, or printed for student use.ushistory.orgprovides the a free online textbook for complete readings of extracts included in the section

The second condition is the increase or decrease in contacts across regions (trade, conflict, migration).  Finally, parallel developments are found across the globe.  Often these events do not happen at the exact same time across the world.  So dates are not the best way to define a period.  Rather, dates act as a guide and often there is controversy over which dates to use.  The example that will be presented is taken from the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills.Two keys ideas that need to be understood are turning points and eras.  First, eras are large periods of time.  As you begin, you will notice that early eras, also known as ages or periods, usually stretch over longer periods of time.  As history moves closer to the present, the period of time is significantly shorter.  What accounts for this difference in time?  Mainly, it’s based on the developments that took place during that period of time.  A second factor is the amount of physical evidence, especially recorded or written evidence.   Early time periods show that developments took much longer than they do today.  Therefore, information is usually more generalized in the early periods and more specific in the modern era.The second key idea is a turning point in history.  A turning point is when a common way of doing things changes.  The causes may vary from region to region and from era to era.  Also, as was stated before, these changes happen at different rates.  A factor that affects the rate of change is contact with other societies such as trade and war.  The more contact, the more that civilization will adapt or risk the chance of being absorbed by a more powerful society.  Other catalysts for change include disease, natural disaster, and advances and spread of technology.Putting the concept of era and turning point together allows historians to group large periods of time together. The periods being introduced below begin with the rise of agriculture and civilization, followed by the rise of regional empires. This trend will continue and lead to trans-regional empires and increased contacts. Key technological advances in the rate at which these contacts take place and the methods and purposes for these contacts eventually connect the Old and New Worlds beyond the idea of trans-regional to a global community of trade, conquest, and diffusion.  Finally, it ends with the 20thcentury when change is accelerated by communication technology, world wars, and global trade.FOUNDATION PERIODThe Foundation period begins in 8,000 BC and continues to 500 BC.  As the name Foundation implies, civilization is in its early developments.  What is significant is the developments that occur in this era will be built on by the following periods, and this process will continue throughout time.  The key firsts are the rise of agriculture and sedentary cultures.  One thing to keep in mind is that prior to those key firsts all societies where nomadic.  Some were still hunters and gatherers but several had begun domesticating animals and are better described as pastoralists.  However, the need for more food to support larger sedentary populations resulted in improvements of farming.  These improvements furthered the population growth and civilization began to blossom into generally small city-states, or states with complex institutions.  The era or period is divided into two sub-periods: the Neolithic (Revolution) and the Ancient River Valley Civilizations.  Finally, the period ends with rise of large, regional empires.CLASSICAL PERIODThe Classical period begins in 500 BC and continues to 600 AD.  The major change that starts this era is the development of large, regional empires.  These empires centralize power through the use of military aristocracies and various forms of bureaucracy.  This allows them to integrate their regions through the use of roads and sea travel.  Permanent traditions largely started in the Foundation era become characteristic of these newly formed regional civilizations. The four main areas are China, India, South West Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea.  These empires make strong contacts between regional centers. Other areas that grew in isolation from Europe and Asia are Mesoamerica and Andean America.  Still, do not forget that though civilization is growing rapidly there are many societies outside classical civilizations that made significant contributions to the regional civilizations, such as pastoralists and other nomads.  The period ends with the collapse of classical empires when massive nomadic invasions sweep through Asia and Europe.POST-CLASSICAL AGEThe Post-Classical period lasts from 600 AD to 1450 AD.  The fall of the great Classical Empires creates an opportunity for civilizations and pastoral societies outside of them to come to prominence. Beginning with rise of Islam, it will become the first trans-regional civilization as it spanned Eurasia and Africa.  The two great powers merge in China and in the Middle East.  The spread of universalizing religions, philosophies of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism promote ideas on equality and will reunite the old regional empires and add new civilizations into a network of global contacts.  These new developments will see the rise of new civilization centers.  The period comes to an end with the conquest of the Mongols, the spread of the Black Death, and Asian technological innovations.CONNECTING EAST & WEST ERAThe Early Modern Era or “Connecting East and West Era” begins in 1450 AD and ends in 1750 AD.  The rise of gunpowder empires in the Middle East and Europe allow for the rise of Western Europe.  Navigation techniques borrowed from Asia allow the Iberian Peninsula to discover the new world and thus the world begins to shrink.  All continents are included in a world network, and global trade takes place for first time.  This leads to the great exchanges of goods, products, flora, fauna, people, germs, and ideas (European and Christianity) between East and West.AGE OF REVOLUTIONThe Age of Revolution begins in 1750 AD and ends in 1914.  The era is characterized by massive changes brought about by technological change caused by the Industrial Revolution, political revolution brought on by the Enlightenment, intellectual change caused by the Renaissance and Reformation, and social change that moves people from rural areas to populated urban centers.  Vast trade networks are solidified and dominated by Europe, which leads to western global hegemony.  The nation-state rises to replace previously formed systems of political control with Great Britain, France, and Germany competing to divide the world.  This is referred to as Imperialism. Others such as Russia, the USA, and Japan join the older European powers.  Western Culture begins to dominate the globe through colonization.MODERN ERAThe Modern era begins in 1914 with World War I and continues to the Present. “Change, Change, Change” are its main calling cards.  Often referred to as The American Century and the Retreat of Europe, two World Wars severely alter the hierarchy of power and Europe’s control over its colonies.  In addition, the areas of the Pacific Rim and India begin to rise.  This leads to the collapse of European colonial empires.  As modernization brings industrialization to the areas outside of initial influence, local values and traditions are challenged.  As modernization promotes westernization, mass culture, promoted by new telecommunication technologies, begins to transform, such as the development of lingua francas, and ways of the past are forgotten.  Lastly, the battle between new political forms pit the political and economic ideas of democracy and free enterprises against socialism, communism, and totalitarianism.  Issue such as genocide and ethnic cleansing promote the development of global organizations which attempt to protect human rights and promote exchange.SPICESSPICES is a mnemonic tool used to help students recall the themes or structures historians use to analyze, evaluate, and compare the information of various societies within and out of an era. S stands for Social Structure, P stands for Political Structure, I stands for Interactions between civilizations, C stands for Cultural Structure, E stands for Economic Structure, S stands for spaces, which is another term used to connect students with geography.Social StructureEconomic, Social ClassesGender Roles, RelationsInequalitiesFamily, KinshipRacial, Ethnic ConstructsPolitical StructureStatesLeadersForms of ControlLawBureaucracyState-building, expansionInteractionsWar, ConflictTrade, CommerceExchanges, MigrationsDiplomacy, AlliancesTransnational OrganizationsCultural StructuresCulturalIntellectualArts, ArchitectureReligionWorld ViewsPhilosophyLifestyles, EntertainmentLiteraturesSecularism, AtheismIdeologies and “isms”Economic StructuresIndustrializationEconomic SystemsCapitalism, SocialismBusiness OrganizationsLabor, Labor OrganizationsTechnologyIndustryScience, Invention, InnovationPowerTransportationCommunicationSpaces = GeographyLocationPhysicalMovementUseEnvironmentLand forms(ISN) Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentsSummarize the reasons Historians break history into eras.Create a timeline of the periodization that will be used in class.  Include the name of eras, dates, and significant turning points.Explain why there is no one accepted convention for periodization.List and define the terms for each letter of the SPICES acronym.(ISN) Discussion and Study QuestionsHow do historians analyze and categorize thousands of years of history?What are the themes used by historians to analyze societies in a given period of time?VocabularyQuizlet Flashcard Vocabulary for Periodization and SPICESeconomicsthe study of the human behaviors practiced by people in order to meet their needs.eraa segment of historical time.periodizationthe division of history into periods or segments of time.Stone Agea historical era existing before humans learned to develop metal technologies, characterized by a hunting and gathering way of life.turning pointsan event marking a unique or important historical change of course.

But what about time dating earlier than that? This ""Prehistoric"" period — before writing and civilizations — is called the Stone Age and is extremely valuable to our understanding of our earliesthominidancestors. Hominids comprise humans today, extinct ancestors, and apes that share similarities with humans.The earliest and longest period of the Stone Age is called the Paleolithic Age. This comes from the Greek wordPalaios, meaning ""long ago"" or ""old,"" andlithos, meaning ""stone"" — put together, Paleolithic Age means Old Stone Age.The Old Stone Age began approximately 4.5 million years ago. It lasted until about 25 thousand years ago — relatively recently in terms of the overall age of the earth. It was at the beginning of the Old Stone Age, approximately 4.4 million years ago, that the first human ancestors made their appearance on earth.Approximately 3.5 million years ago, hominids began walking upright. What did they eat? Where did they live? The archaeological evidence is not clear. Those who study the earliest hominids do know, however, that these human ancestors physically changed in response to their environment.Chill OutDramatic changes in world climate started taking place about 1.5 million years ago. Most of the world became cold — really cold. This plunge in temperature began one of four distinct periods of frigid temperatures known as an Ice Age. Each of these frigid periods lasted from 10,000 to 50,000 years. The most recent chilled the Earth just over 10,000 years ago.During this most recent Ice Age, the northern polar icecap moved so far south that massive sheets of ice were created over much of the northern hemisphere. In some areas the ice was several miles thick. About 1/3 of the earth's surface was encased in an icy layer — that's four times the amount of ice normally found on earth today. Naturally, hunting and gathering abilities were interfered with during the Ice Ages.Once these frigid years were over, a revolution took place — humans started planting crops. This new way of life, which began about 10,000 years ago, led to permanent settlements and the world's first communities. Farming and the domestication of animals mark the beginning of the Neolithic Age, also called the New Stone Age.So what they did they wear and eat? What follows is a look at some of our earliest known human ancestors — how they lived, how they changed, and how they interacted with their environment.Archeologists and anthropologists unearth the remains of prehistoric people. Their work helps to answer profound questions:Who are humans?Where did we come from?Where are we going?Food, Clothing and ShelterCould you survive in the wild? TV shows like ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""Survivor"" and books and movies like ""Lord of the Flies"" ask this question. Small groups of people are set down on a deserted island and left to fend for themselves. They have none of the things we take for granted, such as easy access to food, shelter, clothing, or video games. There are no cities, no roads, no tools, no doctors, no computers — and no malls.In part, these shows are so compelling because it is interesting to ponder how each one of us would do in such a setting. Could you create tools, make rules, gather food, or work with wood? Could you weave clothes, protect your toes, fight off a beast, or know which direction is east?Now take yourself back 20,000 years. For Neanderthal Man, each and every day was a challenge. What was life like for Neanderthals? How did early humans find food, make clothing, and seek shelter?.Hominids, History, and PrehistoryModern day farm animals were pretty different from the original wild animals. Find out where the horse and the chicken came from.Before answering these questions, it will be useful to understand how we know what we know about early hominids. Hominids are from the familyhomidiane,and refer to primate mammals who could stand on two legs. We are hominids as were our ancestors, including Java Man, Neanderthal Man, Beijing Man, and Lucy.When studying humans, historians strongly rely on written records to gather information about the past. History, as it pertains to mankind, is said to begin with the invention of writing, about 5,000 years ago.But humans lived long before the invention of writing.Prehistoryrefers to this long time period before writing was invented. How do we know what life was like if there were no written records of prehistory? Anthropologists and archaeologists work together with other scientists in answering this question. They use artifacts and fossils — clues from ancient times. After testing and analyzing them, educated conclusions are made about life in prehistoric times. Some of the conclusions are wrong, some are somewhat correct, and others may be entirely correct. Some theories will change as the next generations of scientists and historians glean more information.Imagine yourself digging through a stranger's trash. You can draw some conclusions about his or her life based on what you find. While archaeologists don't exactly dig through trash, they do sift through fossil remains and artifacts and try to explain things.For the AgesPrehistory is divided into different time periods. The use of stone tools by early people led historians to apply the name Stone Age to the period before writing became established.The Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, began about 4.5 million years ago and lasted until about 8000 B.C.E. Many anthropologists believe that creatures vaguely resemblingHomo sapiens(that's us today) may have lived at the onset of the Stone Age.The Neolithic, or New Stone Age, lasted from 8000 B.C.E. until approximately 3000 B.C.E. By the end of this era, villages and farms had come into existence.Scientists believe that the earliest hominids may have used caves as shelters. They probably ate vegetables and gathered seeds, fruits, nuts and other edible plants. Later, scientists speculate, meat was added to the diet as small animals were hunted. Eventually, humans hunted large animals.In order to hunt successfully, early men had to work together. As humans became successful hunters, they migrated over great distances in search of food. For nearly a million years, however, periods of extremely cold weather during the Ice Age limited the areas to which early people could migrate. Prehistoric people learned how to use fire and make warm clothing in response to this cold climate.Neanderthals and Cro-MagnonsIn 1856, human remains were found in the Neander Valley of Germany. This is where the Neanderthal people lived some 60,000 years ago. They had stocky builds, heavy jaws, thick eyebrow ridges, and large noses. Unlike hominids who came before them, they made efficient tools and wore heavy clothing made of animal skins.Most Neanderthals lived in groups of 50 people. Some may have dwelled in open-air camps along the shores of lakes and rivers. They cared for their sick and aged and may have been the first to practice a primitive form of medicine.The Cro-Magnons were one of the earliestHomo sapiens.They lived in Europe and lived after the Neanderthals. They lived inside cave entrances while others built huts in forested areas. Long houses made of stone blocks were also used for communities of 30-100 people. Hunting weapons which allowed for a safe distance, such as the spear and bow, were used to hunt the woolly mammoth and bison.How did early Homo Sapiens such as Cro-Magnons compare with humans of today? In essence, we are brainier and they were brawnier. But the similarities, despite the passage of thousands of years, are striking.A Page Right Out of HistoryBecause there was no written language 50,000 years ago, we do not have much information on how a ""modern stone age family"" lived, what they ate, where they lived, what they wore, or even what they looked like. Like Fred Flintstone, did they have leopardskin suits, go barefoot, and use a boulder for a bowling ball?Archaeologists and anthropologist who study this time period do have artifacts upon which they can begin to draw some conclusions. Techniques like carbon dating can help scientists determine the age of objects and bones. Large human skulls, body bones, animal skeletons, cave paintings, and scientific ideas on ancient climate patterns allow scientists to draw a picture of what life may have been like for primitive peopleArchaeologists excavate artifacts at Çatal Hüyük. This Turkish site is one of the oldest human settlements to be discovered.Long and Evolved StoryAs a result of the Neolithic Revolution, humans were forced to settle in one place permanently in order to grow food. Shown here is an example of early Neolithic settlement; the remnants of an early village in Jordan.People living in Africa and advances in agriculture sparked the beginning of the Mesolithic Age or Middle Stone Age. This period lasted from 12,000 till about 10,000 years ago in Africa and Asia, although this date varies according to region. Raising crops for food signifies the beginning of a new way of life for people.The Neolithic Age or New Stone Age was revolutionary. About 10,000 years ago people learned to make better tools and weapons, establish permanent villages and domesticate animals for food and work. They were beginning to live like ""modern"" people.This ""Neolithic or Agricultural Revolution,"" did not happen overnight. It took several millennia after the first discovery of agriculture for people to form settled societies.Jarmo in present day Iraq was one of the oldest. At 8750 years old this little town was home to 200 inhabitants. Catal Huyuk in present day Turkey was an even larger society with almost 3000 residents 8000 years ago.Slowly but surely modern human beings had evolved.VocabularyQuizlet Flashcard Vocabulary on Prehistory TimesStone Agean historical era existing before humans learned to develop metal technologies, characterized by a hunting and gathering way of life.Internet SourcesFirst Peoplesby PBSHuman Evolutionby Smithsonian Institution

3,1.4,The Neolithic Revolution and Rise of River Valley Civilizations,"The Neolithic Revolution and the Rise of River Valley CivilizationsStudent Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section, students will be able toIdentifymajor causes and describe the major effects of the following events from 8000 BC to 500 BC: the development of agriculture.[WHS.1A]The termNeolithic Revolutionwas coined in 1923 by V. Gordon Childe to describe the first in a series of agricultural revolutions in Middle Eastern history. The period is described as a ""revolution"" to denote its importance, and the great significance and degree of change affecting the communities in which new agricultural practices were gradually adopted and refined.The beginning of this process in different regions has been dated from 10,000 to 8,000 BC in the Fertile Crescentand perhaps 8000 BC in the Kuk Early Agricultural Site of Melanesia to 2500 BC in Subsaharan Africa, with some considering the developments of 9000–7000 BC in the Fertile Crescent to be the most important. This transition everywhere seems associated with a change from a largely nomadic hunter-gatherer way of life to a more settled, agrarian-based one, with the inception of the domestication of various plant and animal species—depending on the species locally available, and probably also influenced by local culture. Recent archaeological research suggests that in some regions such as the Southeast Asian peninsula, the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculturalist was not linear, but region-specific.Acivilization(orcivilisationin British English) is any complex state society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labor, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon agriculture, and expansionism. Historically, acivilizationwas an ""advanced"" culture in contrast to more supposedly barbarian, savage, or primitive cultures.In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized feudal or tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists or hunter-gatherers. As an uncountable noun,civilizationalso refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure.Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which, by the engagement in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.Think fire wasn't a big deal?

4,1.5,Tigris and Euphrates River Valley,"At the end of this section, the student will be able toIdentifythe major causes and describe the major effects of the events from 8000 BC to 500 BC: the development of the river valley civilizations.[WHS.1A]Summarizethe impact of the development of farming (Neolithic Revolution) on the creation of river valley civilizations.[WHS.2A]Identifythe characteristics of a civilization.[WHS.2B]Describethe major political, religious/philosophical, and cultural influences of Persia, India, China, Israel, Greece, and Rome, including the development of monotheism, Judaism, and Christianity.[WHS.3A]The Fertile Crescent: Mesopotamia, Sumer, and UrMesopotamia literally means ""(land) between rivers"" in ancient Greek.  The oldest known occurrence of the name Mesopotamia dates to the 4th century BC when it was used to designate the land east of the Euphrates in North Syria.  Later it was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the Tigris, thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and South Eastern Turkey.  The neighboring steppes to the West of the Euphrates and the Western part of the Zagros Mountains are also often included under the wider term Mesopotamia.Throughout the centuries, historians have used these powerful words to describe the Middle East.In the ancient Middle East, many great civilizations rose and fell. The religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam each trace their origins back to this part of the world.All of these civilizations arose in the area known as the Fertile Crescent. The Fertile Crescent stretches from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Zagros Mountains in the east. It is bordered in the north by the Taurus Mountains and in the south by the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Desert. Its shape resembles a crescent moon.One area within the Fertile Crescent gave rise to the region's most powerful empires and grandest cities. This area was Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.Map showing the extent of MesopotamiaThe Fertile Crescent is the region in which humans first began farming and herding around 8,000 B.C.E. This dramatic change from nomadic hunting and gathering allowed early humans to settle into permanent villages and to begin accumulating a surplus of food.With such a surplus, early villagers could begin to focus on developing the skills associated with civilization. Some of them became priests, scribes, merchants, artists, teachers, and government officials. They began to build cities, and before long, they were establishing empires. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, and Phoenicians all built great empires, each of which rose to glory in the Middle East.Because they were constantly interacting through war and trade, the societies in the Middle East borrowed from each other. They modified newly acquired ideas and technologies to suit their own needs. Often, these changes were improvements. Over time, many aspects of various societies throughout the ancient Middle East began to resemble each other.The Middle East is also the crossroads of the ancient world. It is located at the merging point of three continents: Europe, Africa, and Asia. Many travelers who journeyed from one continent to the next passed through the Middle East, absorbing its culture and introducing new ideas to the region. Throughout the centuries, its prized location became the source of conflict. Its goods became the source of envy.And its ideas became the source of faith.The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia by the middle of the 4th millennium BCE, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is hard to tell where the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BCE.By the 3rd millennium BCE, these urban centers had developed into increasingly complex societies. Irrigation and other means of exploiting food sources were being used to amass large surpluses. Huge building projects were being undertaken by rulers, and political organization was becoming ever more sophisticated. Throughout the millennium, the various city-states Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Lagash vied for power and gained hegemony at various times. Nippur and Girsu were important religious centers, as was Eridu at this point. This was also the time of Gilgamesh, a semi-historical king of Uruk, and the subject of the famousEpic of Gilgamesh. By 2600 BCE, the logographic script had developed into a decipherable cuneiform syllabic script.The chronology of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties in our understanding of the text, our understanding of the material culture of the Early Dynastic period and a general lack of radiocarbon dates for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states made for a confusing situation, as each had its own history. The Sumerian king list is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with archaeological evidence. The first of these is Enmebaragesi of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring Elam. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.Enshakushanna of Uruk conquered all of Sumer, Akkad, and Hamazi, followed by Eannatum of Lagash who also conquered Sumer. His methods were force and intimidation (see the Stele of the Vultures), and soon after his death, the cities rebelled and the empire again fell apart. Sometime later, Lugal-Anne-Mundu of Adab created the first, if short-lived, empire to extend west of Mesopotamia, at least according to historical accounts dated centuries later. The last native Sumerian to rule over most of Sumer before Sargon of Akkad established supremacy was Lugal-Zage-Si.During the 3rd millennium BCE, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians which included widespread bilingualism.The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium as asprachbund.Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BCE (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century CE.More details The reconstructed facade of the Neo-Sumerian Great Ziggurat of Ur, near Nasiriyah, IraqThe first writing system. The plow. The sailboat. The first lunar calendar.These accomplishments and more were the products of the city-states of Sumer, which arose on the flood plains of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now modern-day Iraq. The Sumerians began to build their walled cities and make significant advances beginning around 3500 B.C.E.Sumerians also developed high-quality crafts, evidence of which was found in the royal tombs of Ur, excavated by Sir Leonard Woolley in the 1920s. Trade also helped the Sumerians to secure vital items such as timber from Lebanon and luxury goods such as the semiprecious stone lapis lazuli from the Indus River Valley.Because of the surplus grain, the government could grow in size to support numerous officials and priests. It could also pay thousands of workers with barley while they were building canals, city walls, and ziggurats or while they were fighting to defend their city-state or extend its influence over the region. The barley was collected as a tax from the farmers. Farmers were also required to give some time to the government to work on projects. Slaves and hired workers also contributed.As the government and economy grew in size and complexity, officials and merchants required a sophisticated writing system to record transactions. First came number markings and simple pictograms, the writing system began to incorporate pictures representing a physical object or idea (such as a picture of the sun to represent the sun).As trade and government activity increased, the writing system began to incorporate more abstract pictograms and phonograms, or symbols representing sounds. These new forms provided greater flexibility and speed in writing. They were adopted by other cultures (such as the Assyrians) who did not even speak Sumerian.Sumerian WisdomThe Sumerians wrote on clay tablets, using a reed pen called a stylus. Once dried, these tablets became hard and, fortunately for today's researchers, endured for millennia in the hot, dry climate.Thousands of these tablets have been unearthed. Some libraries have even been discovered with over 10,000 of these clay tablets. And although the vast majority of these tablets contain records of goods collected and distributed by the governments and trade transactions, some contain myths, stories, and letters. These documents have provided much information about the culture and history of the Sumerian people.With their ingenuity, the Sumerian people developed complex irrigation systems and a written language. They were the first people to use the plow to lift the silt-laden soil of their crop fields and they invented the sailboat. They were the first people to design a calendar based on the phases of the moon and they developed a numerical system, based on the number 60, that is still used to measure seconds and minutes.GilgameshGilgamesh was likely an actual king of Uruk in Babylonia who lived about 2700 B.C.E.Sumerians recorded stories and myths about Gilgamesh, which were written on clay tablets. The stories were combined into an epic tale. Versions of this tale were translated into other languages including Akkadian, which was spoken by the Babylonians.The fullest surviving version is derived from twelve stone tablets, in the Akkadian language, which was found stored in the famous library at Nineveh of Assyrian King Assurbanipal.The epic relates the heroic deeds of Gilgamesh, who is the king of Uruk. His father is mortal and his mother is a goddess. Since Gilgamesh is part mortal, he knows he must die one day. However, he longs for immortality, whether through doing great deeds or discovering the secret of eternal life. He roams the earth on this quest and meets Utnapishtim, the only human granted eternal life by the gods. He tells Gilgamesh many stories, including one of a great flood that covered the Earth.What happens to Gilgamesh? Read the tale and find out. The following is an excerpt from Gilgamesh.O man of Shuruppak, son of Ubartutu: Tear down the house and build a boat! Abandon wealth and seek living beings! Spurn possessions and keep alive living beings! Make all living beings go up into the boat. The boat which you are to build, its dimensions must measure equal to each other: its length must correspond to its width. Roof it over like the Apsu. From Tablet XI — translation by Maureen Gallery Kovacs, 1998Paving the wayA culture of many firsts, the Sumerians led the way for other societies that followed them.The Babylonians used the innovations of the Sumerians, added to them, and built an empire that gave the world, among other things, codified laws, a tower that soared above the earth, and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.Babylonian language evolved from pictographs to cuneiforms throughout the life of civilization.Geographically, the empire of Babylonia occupied the middle and southern part of Mesopotamia. Situated between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, it stretched from the present-day city of Baghdad south to the Persian Gulf.In 1901, Egyptologist Gustave Jéquier, a member of an expedition headed by Jacques de Morgan, found the stele containing the Code of Hammurabi in what is now Khūzestān, Iran (ancient Susa, Elam), where it had been taken as plunder by the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte in the 12th century BC.Code on a clay tabletThe Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period.The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamentallawregulating a government — i.e., a primitiveconstitution.The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea ofpresumption of innocence, and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provideevidence.The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the Code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, it is copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.""Hammurabi, the king of righteousness, on whom Shamash has conferred the law, am I.""""An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.""This phrase, along with the idea of written laws, goes back to an ancient Mesopotamian culture that prospered long before the Bible was written or the civilizations of the Greeks or Romans flowered.""An eye for an eye ..."" is a paraphrase of Hammurabi's Code, a collection of 282 laws inscribed on an upright stone pillar. The code was found by French archaeologists in 1901 while excavating the ancient city of Susa, which is in modern-day Iran.Hammurabi is the best known and most celebrated of all Mesopotamian kings. He ruled the Babylonian Empire from 1792-50 B.C.E. Although he was concerned with keeping order in his kingdom, this was not his only reason for compiling the list of laws. When he began ruling the city-state of Babylon, he had control of no more than 50 square miles of territory. As he conquered other city-states and his empire grew, he saw the need to unify the various groups he controlled.A Need for JusticeHammurabi keenly understood that to achieve this goal, he needed one universal set of laws for all of the diverse peoples he conquered. Therefore, he sent legal experts throughout his kingdom to gather existing laws. These laws were reviewed and some were changed or eliminated before compiling his final list of 282 laws. Despite what many people believe, this code of laws was not the first.Oldest Code KnownThe oldest known evidence of a law code are tablets from the ancient city Ebla (Tell Mardikh in modern-day Syria). They date to about 2400 B.C.E. — approximately 600 years before Hammurabi put together his famous code.These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.The prologue or introduction to the list of laws is very enlightening. Here, Hammurabi states that he wants ""to make justice visible in the land, to destroy the wicked person and the evil-doer, that the strong might not injure the weak."" The laws themselves support this compassionate claim and protect widows, orphans, and others from being harmed or exploited.The phrase ""an eye for an eye"" represents what many people view as a harsh sense of justice based on revenge. But, the entire code is much more complex than that one phrase. The code distinguishes among punishments for wealthy or noble persons, lower-class persons or commoners, and slaves.The code of laws was arranged in orderly groups so that everyone who read the laws would know what was required of them.(ISN) Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentsConduct a SPICES Analysis on Mesopotamia.

5,1.6,Nile River Valley,"The Nile River ValleyStudent Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section, students will be able toIdentifythe major causes and describe the major effects of the following events from 8000 BC to 500 BC: the development of agriculture and the development of the river valley civilizations.[WHS.1A]Summarizethe impact of the development of farming (Neolithic Revolution) on the creation of river valley civilizations.[WHS.2A]Identifythe characteristics of a civilization.[WHS.2B]explain how major river valley civilizations influenced the development of the classical civilizations.Analyzethe influence of human and physical geographic factors on major events in world history, including the development of river valley civilizations, trade in the Indian Ocean, and the opening of the Panama and Suez canals.[WHS.16B]Ancient EgyptHieroglyphics, pyramids, mummies, the Sphinx of Giza, King Tut, and Cleopatra. The sands of the Nile River Valley hold many clues about one of the most mysterious, progressive, and artistic ancient civilizations. A great deal of evidence survives about how the ancient Egyptians lived, but questions remain. Even the wise sphinx would have trouble answering some of them. How were the pyramids built? Who came up with the idea for mummies and why? What was a typical day like for a pharaoh?In the Nile[Figure 1]The Nile Valley was the seat of an ancient Egyptian civilization that spanned over 4,000 years.In 3,000 B.C.E., Egypt looked similar geographically to the way it looks today. The country was mostly covered by desert. But along the Nile River was a fertile swath that proved — and still proves — a life source for many Egyptians.The Nile is the longest river in the world; it flows northward for nearly 4,200 miles. In ancient times, crops could be grown only along a narrow, 12-mile stretch of land that borders the river. Early Egyptians grew crops such as beans, wheat, and cotton. Despite the lack of many natural resources, such as forests or an abundance of land for farming, a great society emerged.[Figure 2]Craftsmen, Tomb of Nebamun and IpukyEgyptians artisans smelted copper and gold for artistic, architectural, and even military purposes.Earlier in history, Neolithic (late Stone Age) people thrived in the Nile Valley. The remains that have been uncovered date back to about 6,000 B.C.E. But it wasn't until 3,800 B.C.E. that the valley's inhabitants began to form a cohesive civilization.The road to civilization required more organization and increased efficiency. Farmers began producing surplus crops that allowed others not only to concentrate on farming but also to pursue other trades, such as mercantilism or skilled craftwork.Egyptian artisans created copper tools such as chisels and needles — all new inventions — which allowed them to fabricate ornamental jewelry. Artisans also discovered how to make bronze by mixing copper and tin, which marked the beginning of the Bronze Age.Evidence suggests that ancient Egyptians invented the potter's wheel. This tool made it easier to create pots and jars for storage, cooking, religious needs, and decoration.Pharaohs and the Legacy of Ancient EgyptThe pharaohs who ruled Egypt for about 3,000 years were by and large capable administrators, strong military leaders, sophisticated traders, and overseers of great building projects.A Brief Timeline of Ancient EgyptFoundation to DemiseAncient Egypt's great civilization spanned thousands of years, from c. 3000 B.C. until the annexation by Rome in 30 B.C.E.DATE (B.C.E.)EVENT6000First inhabitants settle along the Nile Delta.2900King Menes unites Upper and Lower Egypt.2772365-day calendar is invented.2750The Old Kingdom is established with its capital in Memphis.2560King Khufu (Cheops) builds the Great Pyramids of Giza.2181Instability and corruption weaken the empire.2050The Middle Kingdom is established and the capital moves to Thebes.1750The Hyksos, a group of Semitic-Asiatics, invade and rule Egypt.1550The Hyksos are expelled and the New Kingdom established.1500Queen Hatshepsut expands the empire south (Nubia) and east (Palestine).1380Amenhotep IV (""Akhenaton"") supports worship of only one god, the sun-disk god Aton.1336Tutankhamun (""King Tut"") revives polytheism and returns to the capital to Thebes.1290Ramses II (""The Great"") begins a 67-year reign and completes Temple of Luxor.1283Egyptians and Hittites sign the first recorded peace treaty.712Egypt is invaded from the south by the Nubian Empire, which starts an ""Ethiopian Dynasty.""670Assyrians conquer Egypt.525The Persian Empire conquers Egypt.343Nectanebo II, the last Egyptian-born pharaoh, dies.332Alexander the Great of Macedonia invades Egypt.331The city of Alexandria is established and the Macedonian general Ptolemy begins new dynasty.51The Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII rules Egypt, assisted by Julius Caesar.30Cleopatra commits suicide, and Egypt is annexed by the Roman Empire.Writing also set the Egyptians apart from some of their neighbors. Egyptians used hieroglyphics or pictures to represent words or sounds. This early form of writing was discovered by the Western world after Napoleon's army invaded Egypt in 1798. The Rosetta Stone, a black tablet containing inscriptions, was deciphered and became crucial in unlocking the mystery of hieroglyphics and understanding Egyptian history.[Figure 3]Cursive hieroglyphsAncient Egyptian civilization lasted for several thousand years. Many of its discoveries and practices have survived an even greater test of time.In fact, one of the ancient Egyptians' inventions, the calendar, has helped define time itself.Life Along the NileNone of the achievements of the remarkable ancient Egyptian civilization would have been possible without the Nile River. There is always a connection between landscape and how a people develop. It does not take the wisdom of a sphinx to understand why.Archaeologists and historians don't know exactly how Egyptian civilization evolved. It is believed that humans started living along the Nile's banks starting in about 6,000 B.C.E. For the earliest inhabitants of the Nile Valley food was not easy to find. There were no McTut's selling burgers, and, though there were a lot of crocodiles, those critters were pretty hard to catch.Food for ThoughtOver time, however, despite being in the midst of desert surroundings, people discovered that the Nile River provided many sources of food. Along the river were fruit trees, and fish swam in the Nile in great numbers.[Figure 4]The Nile — the longest river in the world at 4,187 miles — defines Egypt's landscape and culture. A common Egyptian blessing is ""May you always drink from the Nile.""Perhaps most importantly, they discovered that, at the same time each year, the Nile flooded for about six months. As the river receded, it deposited a rich, brown layer of silt that was suitable for growing wheat, beans, barley, or even cotton. Farmers learned to dig short canals leading to fields near the Nile, thus providing fresh water for year-round irrigation. Planting immediately after a flood yielded harvests before the next year's flood.Prime TimeIn order to know when to plant, the Egyptians needed to track days. They developed a calendar based on the flooding of the Nile that proved remarkably accurate. It contained a year of 365 days divided into 12 months of 30 days each. The five extra days fell at the end of the year.Here's a problem that the sphinx might have trouble answering: How did the ancient Egyptians make their calendars? What material did they use? Remember, there was no paper. Need a clue? Take a dip in the Nile.Large reeds called papyrus grew wild along the Nile. The Egyptians developed a process that turned these reeds into flattened material that could be written on (also called papyrus). In fact, the English word ""paper"" has its root in the ancient Greek word ""papyrus."" Among the first things written on papyrus were calendars that tracked time.[Figure 5]Blank papyrus paperPapyrus had many other uses. Boats were constructed by binding the reeds together in bundles. Baskets, mats, rope, and sandals were also fashioned from this multipurpose material.Sand, Land, and CivilizationThe Sahara, the world's largest desert, encroaches on the western shore of the Nile River. Other deserts lie to the Nile's east. Egypt's location within the world's driest region helped protect it from invaders throughout the centuries.Even today, the world around the Nile is quite barren. Outside of the narrow swath of greenery next to the river, there is sand as far as the eye can see. To the Nile's west exists the giant Sahara Desert, the largest desert in the world.From north to south, the Sahara is between 800 and 1,200 miles wide; it stretches over 3,000 miles from east to west. The total area of the Sahara is more than 3,500,000 square miles. It's the world's biggest sandbox.And, as if there weren't enough sand in the Sahara, east of the Nile are other deserts.Although sand had limited uses, these deserts presented one tremendous strategic advantage: few invaders could ever cross the sands to attack Egypt — the deserts proved too great a natural barrier.After learning to take advantage of the Nile's floods — and not having to fear foreign attacks — the Egyptians concentrated on improving farming techniques. As the years passed, Egyptians discovered that wheat could be baked into bread, that barley could be turned into soup (or even beer), and that cotton could be spun into clothing.With many of life's necessities provided, the Egyptians started thinking about other things, such as art, government, religion, and philosophy — some of the basics needed to create a civilization. Eventually, pyramids, mummies, Cleopatra, and the Sphinx of Giza became touchstones of this flourishing culture.Egyptian Social StructureEgyptian society was structured like a pyramid. At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Osiris, and Isis. Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe. Therefore, it was important to keep them happy. They could make the Nile overflow, cause famine, or even bring death.[Figure 6]In Egyptian times, people of higher status would sometimes be drawn or sculpted larger than those of lower status.The Egyptians also elevated some human beings to gods. Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects. After pharaohs died, huge stone pyramids were built as their tombs. Pharaohs were buried in chambers within the pyramids.[Figure 7]A typical depiction of a pharaoh. After Djoser of the Third Dynasty, pharaohs were usually depicted wearing the nemes headdress, a false beard, and an ornate kilt.Because the people of Egypt believed that their pharaohs were gods, they entrusted their rulers with many responsibilities. Protection was at the top of the list. The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh. Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grain, which were stored in the pharaoh's warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine.The Chain of CommandAncient Egyptian royalty, nobility, and clergy enjoyed lives of wealth and comfort while farmers and slaves struggled to subsistNo single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected.Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write.Noble AimsRight below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions, they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods. All Egyptians — from pharaohs to farmers — gave gifts to the gods.Soldier OnSoldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces.Skilled workers such as physicians and craftspersons made up the middle class. Craftspersons made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.The Bottom of the HeapAt the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could be as much as 60 percent of their yearly harvest — that's a lot of hay!Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades. These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on to gain employment in the government. It was possible for a boy born on a farm to work his way up into the higher ranks of the government. Bureaucracy proved lucrative.DynastiesWhat's a dynasty?It's a powerful group or family that maintains its position for a number of years. The New York Yankees baseball team of the 1920s is considered a dynasty because they went to the World Series almost every year and had great leaders, such as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.Ancient Egypt also had dynasties. They were families who often ruled for a considerable number of years and did impressive things — such as building pyramids — during their rule.The history of ancient Egypt is divided into three main periods: the Old Kingdom (about 2,700-2,200 B.C.E.), the Middle Kingdom (2,050-1,800 B.C.E.), and the New Kingdom (about 1,550-1,100 B.C.E.). The New Kingdom was followed by a period called the Late New Kingdom, which lasted to about 343 B.C.E. (Intermediate kingdoms — those without strong ruling families — filled the gaps of time in between the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms.)During these periods, power passed from one dynasty to another. A dynasty ruled until it was overthrown or there were no heirs left to rule. Each kingdom ended in turmoil either after a period of infighting or after being invaded.There were more than 30 dynasties in Egyptian history. Dynasties helped keep Egypt united, which was no easy task. Leaders faced periods of chaos, ambitious rivals, and also foreigners who wanted to conquer the region.The Earliest DynastyBeginning in about 4,000 B.C.E., all of Egyptian society existed in two kingdoms, Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Around 3,100 B.C.E., Menes, the king of Upper Egypt, started the long string of dynasties by conquering Lower Egypt. He unified the regions and built his capital city at Memphis, near the border of these two kingdoms. Because Memphis was located on an island in the Nile, it was easy to defend.So began the first dynasty, an age appropriately called the Early Dynastic Period. Little is known of the pharaohs (rulers) of the early dynasties. The Egyptian word ""pharaoh"" literally means ""great house.""Pharaohs were more than just rulers. They were considered gods and were believed to possess the secrets of heaven and earth. Pharaohs led the government and the army and wielded unlimited power.The step pyramid of Netjerikhet in Saqqara believed to have been the first pyramid constructed in Egypt, was completed in the 27th century B.C.E. during the Third Dynasty. Pyramid building progressed through the dynasties, culminating in the Pyramids of Giza.[Figure 8]Pyramids of GizaThe Old KingdomAbout 300 years after Menes united Egypt, its rulers formed a central government in which they held supreme power. This was the beginning of the Old Kingdom. (Kings tend to rule from a central place, which is why the early dynastic period is not considered a kingdom.)Amenemhat III was one of the great rulers of the Middle Kingdom. During his time as pharaoh, the Pyramid of Hawara was built.During the Old Kingdom, pyramid building flourished. Cheops had the six-million-ton Great Pyramid of Giza constructed as his tomb. Under Chephren, a Fourth Dynasty ruler, the Great Sphinx was built.The end of the Old Kingdom was marked by civil wars between pharaohs and nobles.The Middle KingdomMontuhotep II (2,007-1,956 B.C.E.), an Eleventh dynasty pharaoh, was the last ruler of the Old Kingdom and the first ruler of the Middle Kingdom. He and his successors restored political order.The Middle Kingdom is remembered as a time of flourishing arts, particularly in jewelry making. Egypt became a great trading power during this period and continued massive construction projects. Eventually, the long reign of prosperity gave way to old problems: crop failures, economic woes, dynastic power struggles, and foreign invaders.Amenemhet III (1817-1772 B.C.E.), of the Twelfth Dynasty, was responsible for the construction of two great projects. He completed the building of the giant waterwheels of the Faiyum region that diverted the floodwaters of the Nile. Amenemhet also constructed the Pyramid of Hawara, which became known as the Labyrinth. It contained about 3,000 rooms.Trouble struck when a group of foreigners, the Hyksos, a Semitic-Asiatic group, invaded the Nile Delta region. These advanced warriors used new tools for war: bronze weapons and horse-drawn chariots. They defeated the Egyptians, who fought on foot with copper-and-stone weapons.The New KingdomEarly pharaohs of the New Kingdom evicted the Hyksos. The New Kingdom is remembered as a time of renaissance in artistic creation, but also as the end of dynastic rule. This period was also marred by corrupt priests and tomb-robbing by government officials.A famed pharaoh of the new period was Amenhotep IV, who triggered a religious revolution. Before Amenhotep's rule, Egypt was a polytheistic society that believed in many gods, the most important named Amon. But, Amenhotep believed only in Aton, the sun god. Belief in only one god (monotheism) was a radical notion. To show his devotion to Aton, the pharaoh changed his name to Akenhaton (""he who is loyal to Aton""). Akenhaton moved his capital from Thebes, where Amon was worshipped, to Tell el Amarna.Naturally, the priests who represented the other gods did not like this change one bit. Many Egyptians also did not like the pharaoh discrediting their gods. After the death of Akenhaton, the powerful priests forced the new capital to be moved back to Thebes .Tut-TutThe pharaoh who moved the capital back to Thebes was a boy-king. He ruled for nine years, attempted to pacify the priests, and was responsible for some modest building projects. He began his reign at the age of 10 but died of a head injury at 19.But, his name is famous: Tutankhamun, or more familiarly, King Tut. Tut is mostly remembered because of his beautiful tomb — one of the very few that was not pillaged by grave robbers.Ramses II, or Ramses the Great, was another important ruler during this period. He reigned for 67 years and died in about 1,213 B.C.E. at age 96. His nearly 200 wives and concubines bore 96 sons and 60 daughters. Not only did Ramesses build a great family, he also built two temples at Abu Simbel, a covered hall of giant pillars at Karnak, additions at the Luxor Temple, and the Ramesseum, a compound consisting of two temples and a palace.After Ramses' rule, Egypt fell into steady decline. Today, his 3,000-year-old mummy lies in a display case on the second floor of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt's capital.Over the course of the next nine centuries, the Nubians, the Assyrians, and the Persians bounded into Egypt and ravaged the area. When Pharaoh Nectanebo II retreated to Memphis to avoid death at the hands of oncoming Persian invaders in 343 B.C.E., he became the last Egyptian-born pharaoh, ending over 2,500 years of Egyptian self-rule.PyramidsFor centuries, they were the tallest structures on the planet. The Pyramids of Giza, built over 4,000 years ago, still stand atop an otherwise flat, sandy landscapeOne of the Seven Wonders of the World, the pyramids defy 21st-century humans to explain their greatest secrets. How could a civilization that lacked bulldozers, forklifts, and trucks build such massive structures? Why would anyone have spent the time and energy to attempt such a task? What treasures were placed inside these monuments?Only a powerful pharaoh could marshal the necessary human resources to build giant pyramids. During the flood seasons, farmers became builders. Huge stone blocks averaging over two tons in weight were mined in quarries and transported to the pyramid site.Egyptologists theorize that the workers used either rollers or slippery clay to drag the blocks from the quarries to their eventual placement on the pyramid. Construction of the larger pyramids took decades.Why Pyramids?Pyramids were built for religious purposes. The Egyptians were one of the first civilizations to believe in an afterlife. They believed that a second self called thekalived within every human being. When the physical body expired, the ka enjoyed eternal life. Those fortunate enough to pass the test of Osiris wanted to be comfortable in their lives beyond earth. The Great Pyramids were simply grand tombs of powerful pharaohs.Three pyramids were built at Giza, and many smaller pyramids were constructed around the Nile Valley. The tallest of the Great Pyramids reaches nearly 500 feet into the sky and spans an area greater than 13 acres. The Great Sphinx was sculpted nearby to stand watch over the pyramids. It stands 65 feet tall and consists of a human head atop the body of a lion.Many believe that the Sphinx was a portrait of King Chefren (Khafret), who was placed in the middle Pyramid. The lion symbolized immortality.You Take It with YouEgyptians who ranked high in status often wanted to take their most prized possessions with them in death, so the ka could enjoy them in its next life. Gold, silver, and bronze artifacts were loaded into the interiors of the great tombs. Fine linens and artwork adorned the secret chambers.In the early days, dead nobles were often interned with their living slaves and animals. Because this practice eventually proved too costly, artists instead depicted scenes of human activity on the inside walls. Some pyramids were even equipped with a rest room for the pharaoh.Inside pyramids such as this one for King Pepi I, passageways lead to a main burial chamber. Designs varied for each pyramidGreat precautions were taken to protect the tombs from looters. Egyptians believed that a defiler of a pharaoh's resting place would be cursed for eternity. The entrance to the inner chambers was carefully hidden. The pharaoh's mummy was placed in a huge coffin called a sarcophagus, which was made of the hardest known stone blocks. But despite such warnings and precautions, tombs were raided over the years by grave robbers.The pyramids, however, have stood the test of time. Although their outer limestone layers have long since been stripped or passed into dust, the pyramids still stand. About 80 dot the horizons of modern Egypt. They remain as time capsules cast forward by a once-great civilization.(ISN) Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentsConduct a SPICES analysis of ancient Egypt.

[WH.27A]Indus River Valley CivilizationsGeography and Time FrameIn 1856, British colonial officials in India were busy monitoring the construction of a railway connecting the cities of Lahore and Karachi in modern-day Pakistan along theIndus River Valley.As they continued to work, some of the laborers discovered many fire-baked bricks lodged in the dry terrain. There were hundreds of thousands of fairly uniform bricks, which seemed to be quite old. Nonetheless, the workers used some of them to construct the roadbed, unaware that they were using ancient artifacts. They soon found among the bricks stone artifacts made of soapstone, featuring intricate artistic markings.Though they did not know it then, and though the first major excavations did not take place until the 1920s, these railway workers had happened upon the remnants of the Indus Valley Civilization, also known as theHarappan Civilization, after Harappa. It was the first of its sites to be excavated in what was then the Punjab province of British India and is now in Pakistan. Initially, many archaeologists thought they had found ruins of the ancient Maurya Empire, a large empire which dominated ancient India between c. 322 and 185 BCE.Before the excavation of these Harappan cities, scholars thought that Indian civilization had begun in the Ganges Valley as Aryan immigrants from Persia and central Asia populated the region around 1250 BCE. The discovery of ancient Harappan cities unsettled that conception and moved the timeline back another 1500 years, situating the Indus Valley Civilization in an entirely different environmental context.[Figure 2]Relief map of PakistanImagecourtesy Wikimedia CommonsScholars are still piecing together information about this mysterious civilization, but they have learned a great deal about it since its rediscovery. Its origins seem to lie in a settlement namedMehrgarhin the foothills of a mountain pass in modern-day Balochistan in western Pakistan. There is evidence of settlement in this area as early as 7000 BCE.The Indus Valley Civilization is often separated into three phases: theEarly Harappan Phasefrom 3300 to 2600 BCE, theMature Harappan Phasefrom 2600 to 1900 BCE, and theLate Harappan Phasefrom 1900 to 1300 BCE.This map shows the extent of the Indus Valley Civilization during the Mature Harappan Phase. Civilization is highlighted in brown in the area of modern-day Pakistan and northern India. The rest of the map is green and is a partial map of India and the area northwest of Pakistan.[Figure 3]Indus Valley Civilization in the Mature Harappan Phase (2600-1900 BCE)Imagecourtesy Wikimedia CommonsAt its peak, the Indus Valley Civilization may have had a population of over five million people. The Indus cities are noted for theirurban planning, a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment. They are also noted for their baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, and clusters of large, nonresidential buildings.The Indus Valley Civilization began to decline around 1800 BCE. Archaeological evidence indicates that trade with Mesopotamia, located largely in modern Iraq, seemed to have ended. The advanced drainage systems and baths of the great cities were built over or blocked. Writing began to disappear, and the standardized weights and measures used for trade and taxation fell out of use.Urban infrastructure and architectureBy 2600 BCE, small early Harappan communities had developed into large urban centers. These cities include Harappa, Ganeriwala, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, Rupar, and Lothal in modern-day India. In total, more than 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Indus River and its tributaries.Mohenjo-darois thought to have been built in26BCE; it became not only the largest city of the Indus Valley Civilization but one of the world’s earliest major urban centers. Located west of the Indus River in the Larkana District, Mohenjo-daro was one of the most sophisticated cities of the period, with advanced engineering and urban planning.[Figure 4]Archaeological remains at the lower town of Lothal, showing uniform fire-baked bricks. Fire-baked bricks will hold up to moisture, making them suited to building baths and sewers.Imagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Harappawas a fortified city in modern-day Pakistan that is believed to have been home to as many as 23,500 residents living in sculpted houses with flat roofs made of red sand and clay. The city spread over 150 hectares—370 acres—and had fortified administrative and religious centers of the same type used in Mohenjo-Daro.Both cities had similar organization and featuredcitadels, central areas in a city that were heavily fortified—protected with defensive military structures. Additionally, both cities were situated along the Indus River. This structure would have allowed those at the higher levels of the buildings in either city to look down the river and see into the distance.The remains of the Indus Valley Civilization cities indicate remarkable organization; there were well-ordered wastewater drainage and trash collection systems and possibly even public baths, andgranaries, which are storehouses for grain. Most city-dwellers were artisans and merchants grouped together in distinct neighborhoods. The quality of urban planning suggests efficient municipal governments that placed a high priority on hygiene or religious ritual.Harappans demonstrated advanced architecture with dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls. These massive walls likely protected the Harappans from floods and may have deterred military conflicts. Unlike Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization did not build large, monumental structures. There is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples—or even of kings, armies, or priests—and the largest structures may be granaries. The city of Mohenjo-daro contains the Great Bath, which may have been a large, public bathing and social area.The Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro: Amid the brick ruins of a third-millennium BCE city, stairs descend on two sides into a large, rectangular brick-lined pit. Wooden stakes and wire encircle the perimeter, preventing entry by modern-day tourists.[Figure 5]Excavated ruins of Mohenjo-daro, with the Great Bath in the foreground and the Buddhist Stupa in the background.Imagecourtesy of Wikipedia.Innovation and exchangeThe people of the Indus River Valley Civilization achieved many notable advances in technology, including great accuracy in their systems and tools for measuring length and mass. Fire-baked bricks—which were uniform in size and moisture-resistant—were important in building baths and sewage structures and are evidence that Harappans were among the first to develop a system ofstandardized weights and measures. The consistency of brick size across cities also suggests unity across the various urban areas, which is evidence of a broader civilization.[Figure 6]Archaeological dig of a water reservoir at DholaviraImagecourtesy of Wikipedia.Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and the recently partially-excavated Rakhigarhi demonstrate the world's first known urban sanitation systems. The ancient Indus systems of sewage and drainage developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in many areas of Pakistan and India today. Individual homes drew water from wells, while wastewater was directed to covered drains on the main streets. Houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes, and even the smallest homes on the city outskirts were believed to have been connected to the system, further supporting the conclusion that cleanliness was a matter of great importance.Harappans are known for seal carving— the cutting of patterns into the bottom face of a seal, a small, carved object used for stamping. They used these distinctive seals for the identification of property and to stamp clay on trade goods. Seals—decorated with animal figures, such as elephants, tigers, and water buffaloes—have been one of the most commonly discovered artifacts in Indus Valley cities.[Figure 7]Mold of a seal from the Indus Valley civilizationImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.The Indus River Valley Civilization is considered a Bronze Age society; inhabitants of the ancient Indus River Valley developed new techniques inmetallurgy—the science of working with copper, bronze, lead, and tin. Harappans also performed intricate handicraft using products made of the semi-precious gemstone Carnelian.Evidence shows Harappans participated in a vast maritime (sea) trade network extending from Central Asia to the Middle East. The civilization's economy appears to have depended significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The Harappan Civilization may have been the first to use wheeled transport, in the form of oxcarts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today. It also appears they built boats and watercraft—a claim supported by archaeological discoveries of a massive, dredged canal, and what is regarded as a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal. Harappans also engaged in shell working, and shells used in their crafts have origins from as far away as the coast of modern-day Oman.[Figure 8]A modern-day oxcart in Punjab, IndiaImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Trade focused on importing raw materials to be used in Harappan city workshops, including minerals from Iran and Afghanistan, lead and copper from other parts of India, jade from China, and cedar wood floated down rivers from the Himalayas and Kashmir. Other trade goods included terracotta pots, gold, silver, metals, beads, flints for making tools, seashells, pearls, and colored gemstones, such as lapis lazuli and turquoise.One of the ways historians know about the maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilizations is the discovery of Harappan seals and jewelry at archaeological sites in regions of Mesopotamia, which includes most of modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, and parts of Syria. Long-distance sea trade over bodies of water—such as the Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf—may have become feasible with the development of plank watercraft that were each equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth.Historians have also made inferences about networks of exchange based on similarities between artifacts across civilizations. Between 4300 and 3200 BCE—part of theChalcolithic period, also known as the Copper Age—ceramics from the Indus Valley Civilization area show similarities with southern Turkmenistan and northern Iran. During the Early Harappan period—about 3200 to 2600 BCE—there are cultural similarities in pottery, seals, figurines, and ornaments that document caravan trade with Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.Religion, Language, and CultureLittle is known about Harappan religion and language. A collection of written texts on clay and stone tablets unearthed at Harappa—which have been carbon dated 3300-3200 BCE—contain trident-shaped, plant-like markings that appear to be written from right to left. There is considerable debate about whether it was an encoded language at all and whether it is related to Indo-European and South Indian language families. The Indus script remains indecipherable without any comparable symbols and is thought to have evolved independently of the writing in Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Researchers are using technological advances in computer science in order to attempt to decipher it.[Figure 9]The 'Ten Indus Scripts' discovered near the northern gateway of the citadel DholaviraImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.The Harappan religion also remains a topic of speculation. It has been widely suggested that the Harappans worshipped a mother goddess who symbolized fertility. In contrast to Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization seems to have lacked any temples or palaces that would give clear evidence of religious rites or specific deities.[Figure 10]A collection of Indus valley seals.Imagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Many Indus Valley seals include the forms of animals; some depict the animals being carried in processions, while others show mythological creations like unicorns, leading scholars to speculate about the role of animals in Indus Valley religions. Interpretations of these animal motifs include signification of membership in a clan, elite class, or kin structure. One seal from Mohenjo-daro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger. This may be a reference to the Sumerian myth of a monster created by Aruru—the Sumerian earth and fertility goddess—to fight Gilgamesh, the hero of an ancient Mesopotamian epic poem. This is a further suggestion of international trade in Harappan culture.Indus Valley excavation sites have revealed a number of distinct examples of the culture’s art, including sculptures, seals, pottery, gold jewelry, and anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta, bronze, and steatite.[Figure 11]Indus Priest/King Statue. The statue is 17.5 cm high and carved from steatite. It was found in Mohenjo-daro in 1927Imagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Among the various gold, terracotta, and stone figurines found was a figure of a priest-king displaying a beard and patterned robe. Another figurine in bronze, known as theDancing Girl, is only 11 centimeters high and shows a female figure in a pose that suggests the presence of some choreographed dance form enjoyed by members of the civilization. Terracotta works also included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. In addition to figurines, the Indus River Valley people are believed to have created necklaces, bangles, and other ornaments.[Figure 12]Replica of 'Dancing Girl' of Mohenjo-daro at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, IndiaImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Institutions and HierarchiesHow was Harappan society organized, and what institutions functioned as centers of authority? Archaeological records provide no immediate answers regarding a center of authority or depictions of people in power in Harappan society, and there are few written records to consult. However, Harrapan artifacts display an extraordinary uniformity. Pottery, seals, weights, and bricks with standardized sizes and weights, suggest some form of authority and governance, though it is not clear what that form was exactly.Over time, various theories have developed concerning Harappan systems of rule. One theory is that there was a single state encompassing all the communities of the civilization; this theory is supported by the similarity in artifacts, the evidence of planned settlements, the standardized ratio of brick size, and the apparent establishment of settlements near sources of raw material. Another theory posits that there was no single ruler, but rather a number of leaders representing each of the urban centers, including Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, and other communities. It seems likely that there was not one centralized and all-powerful state but that various classes and centers of power were integrated into a decentralized structure.Written records gave historians a great deal of insight into the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, but very few written materials have been discovered in the Indus valley. Though seal inscriptions do seem to have written information, scholars have not been able to decipher the Indus script. As a result, they have had considerable difficulty understanding the nature of the state and religious institutions of the Indus Valley Civilization. We know relatively little about their legal codes, procedures, and systems of governance.Historians have made educated guesses about the nature of Harappan civilization from the available artifacts and physical structures. Some experts have theorized that the Indus Valley Civilization had no rulers as we understand them and that everyone enjoyed equal status. Some evidence in support of this conclusion is that most Harappan residents seem to have enjoyed relatively equal health and that there were not many elite burials, which archaeologists have discerned throughmortuary analysis—the study of graves and deposits containing human remains.However, this does not conclusively prove that Harappan society lacked any social hierarchy, and it could possibly be the result of other factors, like different beliefs about the afterlife. Some scholars point to varying house sizes and varied heights of structures to suggest that different social classes occupied different levels in the cities. Others identify items such as painted pottery, bangles, beaded ornaments, and even location within cities as indicators of wealth. A considerable degree of craft specialization also suggests some degree of socio-economic stratification.It is widely believed that the Harappan civilization was a peaceful one that did not engage in any warfare, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this belief, and some archaeologists consider it a pervasive myth. Some scholars argue that Harappans were peaceful primarily because there were no natural enemies due to the geographic location of the major cities. Weapons have been found at sites, but there is debate as to whether they were used in conflict with other groups or as a defense against wild animals.DeclineThe Indus Valley Civilization declined around 1800 BCE and scholars debate which factors resulted in the civilization’s demise. One theory suggested that a nomadic, Indo-European tribe called the Aryans invaded and conquered the Indus Valley Civilization, though more recent evidence tends to contradict this claim. Many scholars believe that the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization was caused by climate change. Some experts believe the drying of the Saraswati River, which began around 1900 BCE, was the main cause for climate change, while others conclude that a great flood struck the area.Various elements of the Indus Civilization are found in later cultures, suggesting the civilization did not disappear suddenly due to an invasion. Many scholars argue that changes in river patterns caused the large civilization to break up into smaller communities calledlate Harappan cultures.Another disastrous change in the Harappan climate might have been eastward-movingmonsoons or winds that bring heavy rains. Monsoons can be both helpful and detrimental to a climate, depending on whether they support or destroy vegetation and agriculture.By 1800 BCE, the Indus Valley climate grew cooler and drier, and a tectonic event may have diverted or disrupted river systems, which were the lifelines of the Indus Valley Civilization. The Harappans may have migrated toward the Ganges basin in the east, where they could have established villages and isolated farms. These small communities would not have been able to produce the same agricultural surpluses to support large cities. With the reduced production of goods, there would have been a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia. By around 1700 BCE, most of the Indus Valley Civilization cities had been abandoned.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Video AssignmentWatch:Indus Valley Civilizationby Crash Course World HistoryWhat are four symptoms of civilization?Why did the first civilizations arise near river valleys?What are the accomplishments of the Indus Valley Civilization?Why did the Indus Valley Civilization come to an end?Interactive Notebook AssignmentsConduct a SPICE analysis ofthe Indus Valley Civilization.Complete aS.P.I.C.E.chart and identify at least three characteristics for each category in the SPICE acronym.Create a graphic organizerexplaining themajor accomplishments ofthe Indus Valley Civilization.Write a summary of the most plausiblereasonfor why the Indus Valley Civilization declined.Review QuestionsWhat characteristics make theIndus Valley civilization a ""civilization""?What type of governments do historians believe existed in theIndus River Valley?How did geographyinfluencethe development of theIndusValley Civilization?How didHarrapansimpactthe environmentalong theIndusRiver Valley?Do you believe the Indus Valley Civilization was peaceful and enjoyed social inequality?

[WH.27A]ChinaBy USHistory.orgThe Middle Kingdom[Figure 2]To prevent flooding of the north China plain by the Yellow River, Yu the Great organized large-scale projects in irrigation and dike-building. Yu then went on to found the first dynasty of China, the Xia.From the misty veil of prehistory emerged the myths of ancient China. Heroes turned to gods, and men and beasts performed miraculous feats. Their myths explain the discoveries of the tools and practices used by the Chinese to the present-day.Yet Chinese mythology has never contained any clear-cut creation stories. The people of China existed long before creation myths became popular. Instead, the earliest Chinese myths center on issues that everyday people had to face. One example involves a man named Yu.The Legend of YuFlooding worried Emperor Shun. The Yellow River and its springs had overflowed, destroying farmland and putting people in danger. So the emperor consulted his advisors to find a way to stop the flooding. They all agreed that a man by the name of Yu, who could transform into a dragon or a bear, was the only one who could succeed where others had failed.Yu's own father, Kun, had tried for ten years to build dams and dig ditches without success, the waters always overflowing any attempts to tame them. Upon the emperor's request, Yu came up with a plan. Yu knew that in Heaven there was a special ""swelling soil"" that multiplied when it touched water. He humbly asked the gods for the soil, and received it with their blessings. With the help of a winged dragon, Yu flew all over the land, using the soil to plug 250,000 springs, the sources of the water.That problem solved, Yu turned his attention to the Yellow River and the flood waters that still remained. Amazingly, the solution came not from the mind of Yu, but in the form of a map on the back of a tortoise shell. Using the map, and later, the help of the gods, Yu and his dragon were able to dig irrigation ditches that finally diverted the water off the farmland and saved the day. As a reward for his diligence, upon the death of Shun, Yu the Great became the first emperor of the Xia dynasty.The Real XiaAlthough the myths of Yu and others made great stories, for centuries they had no archaeological evidence to support them. So what is actually known about ancient China? Until 1928 when archaeologists excavated a site at Anyang in the Henan Province of China, no one knew what parts, if any, of these ancient tales were true. However, at Anyang, remnants of cities, bronze tools, and tombs were found in the same places spoken of in ancient Chinese myths. These sites and artifacts proved the existence of the first dynasty established by Yu.The Xia were able to harvest silk for clothing and artwork, created pottery using the potter's wheel, and were very knowledgeable about farming practices such as irrigation. The Xia dynasty lasted approximately five hundred years, from the 21st to the 16th century B.C.E. It connected the Longshan people, who were the earliest culture of China known for their black-lacquered pottery, with the Shang dynasty that came much later.An Impenetrable LandThe Chinese are the longest continuous civilization in the world, spanning 7,000 years of history. How could Chinese civilization survive when so many other cultures have come and gone? One possible answer lies in the physical geography of the region.[Figure 3]The Yellow Emperor, Huang Di, is supposed to have founded China in approximately 4000 BCE. There is no archaeological evidence to support that claim, however, leaving Huang Di obscured through the veil of history and Chinese mythology as a part-real, part-legendary figure.With vast mountain ranges including the Himalayas standing imposingly to the southwest, the Gobi Desert to the north, and the Pacific Ocean stretching out to the east, the Chinese were in relative isolation from the rest of the world until the 1800s. In fact, because they believed they were in the middle of the world, surrounded by natural barriers on all sides, the Chinese thought of themselves as ""Zhong Guo"" — the Middle Kingdom.Foreign invaders had great difficulty reaching China, and many of the most important discoveries, inventions, and beliefs of the West remained unknown to the Middle Kingdom. In the early years of their civilization, the Chinese developed a unique writing system, began using bronze for both tools and art, and created folk religions that later evolved into the philosophies of Taoism and Confucianism. These discoveries enabled the Chinese to develop a culture unlike any other the world has ever known.Shang DynastyBy Khan AcademyThe first dynastyThe very earliest period in traditional Chinese history is called theMythical Period, when—according to legend—theXia dynastyruled China. TheShang dynasty, the first historically confirmed dynasty, supposedly began when the Shang overthrew the Xia sometime around 1760 BCE.Did this overthrow actually happen? We’re not sure. The Shang dynasty is the oldest Chinese dynasty whose existence is supported by archaeological finds, but more evidence for the existence of the Xia dynasty may yet emerge.It’s estimated that the Shang ruled the Yellow River Valley of China for most of the second millennium BCE—so about 1766 to 1046 BCE.[Figure 4]Region controlled by Shang dynastyImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.For centuries, people found what they called dragon bones—bones and shells with mysterious inscriptions—in many parts of China. Excavations of the ancient city of Anyang in the early twentieth century revealed tens of thousands of these bone fragments and bronze vessels, many of which had inscriptions in proto-Chinese characters.These artifacts contained records dating back to the Shang dynasty, allowing scholars to learn much about Shang life, such as their agricultural methods, medical treatments, a legal system, and craft making styles.The Shang built huge cities with strong social class divisions, expanded earlier irrigation systems, excelled in the use of bronze, and developed a writing system. Shang kings fulfilled a sacred, not political, role, while a council of chosen advisers and bureaucrats—official administrators—organized and ran the government.Both banks of the Yellow River had massive amounts ofloess (pronounced like the English word, less)—a fertile sediment that allowed Shang-era farmers to grow a large surplus of food. This supported specialization and allowed a class of Shang artisans and craftspeople to develop sophisticated technology and culture.Ultimately, the Shang dynasty was overthrown in 1046 BCE by the Zhou, asubject people—a people who lived under the imperial rule—living in the western part of the kingdom. Their cultural contributions continued to be carried on through future dynasties.Writing and CultureThe oldest surviving form of Chinese writing is found as inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals, calledoracle bones(oracle, from a similar Latin root as the English wordorator, means holy messenger or speaker). The writing found on oracle bones shows complexity, indicating that this language had existed for a long time. In fact, modern scholars are able to read it because the language is very similar to the modern Chinese writing system.Oracle bones are pieces of bone or turtle shell that were used by the ancient Chinese, especially Chinese kings, in attempts to predict the future. The ancient kings would inscribe their name and the date on the bone along with a question. They would then heat the bone until it cracked and then interpret the shape of the crack, which was believed to provide an answer to their question.[Figure 5]Ox scapula with a divination inscription from the Shang dynastyImagecourtesy of Wikipedia.Different questions have been found carved into oracle bones, such as, ""Will we win the upcoming battle?"" or ""How many soldiers should we commit to the battle?"" The bones revealed a great deal about what was important to Shang society and often asked questions about war, harvests, and childbirth.Toward the end of the dynasty, this practice ofdivination—predicting the future—was reserved for the king alone. As a result, oracle bones from this period give historians comparatively less insight into the lives and concerns of people in other classes.Writing allowed science in the Shang dynasty to advance, as observations could be recorded more accurately. The Oracle Scripts are accounts of eclipses and other celestial events written by astronomers of the Shang period. Shang astronomers’ works also showed advances in mathematics, the development of odd and even numbers, and principles of accounting. TheI-Ching—also known asThe Book of Changes—was either written or compiled at this same time, around 1250 to 1150 BCE. The I-Ching is a book of divination with roots going back to the fortune tellers of the rural areas and their oracle bones.Musical instruments were also developed by the Shang. At Yin Xu, near Angyang, excavations have revealed instruments from the Shang period such as the ocarina—a wind instrument—drums, and cymbals. Bells, chimes, and bone flutes have been discovered elsewhere.The Shang created a lunar calendar, based on the cycles of the moon, that was used to predict and record important events, especially the planting and harvesting of crops. Because lunar years are shorter than solar years, which are based on the Earth’s orbit of the sun, Shang kings employed specially trained astronomers who made adjustments and maintained the precision of the calendar.Technological Innovation and ExchangeBronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was a hugely important metal during the Shang period. Shang metalworkers developed a highly sophisticated method for casting bronze and used it to make ceremonial objects and weapons. Bronze swords and spearheads were stronger than other available metals, giving Shang soldiers an advantage in battle.[Figure 6]A Shang dynasty bronze vessel, often ceremonial objects, used to make offerings to ancestorsImagecourtesy of Wikipedia.Mastery of bronze was an important advancement for the Shang militarily, but the combination of horse, chariot, and composite bow were also integral to its success. The chariot, a two-wheeled war cart pulled by horses, allowed Shang soldiers to move vast distances at great speeds and also acted as a mobile archery platform. Shang archers also had composite bows, made by combining animal sinew and horn or bone with wood. These materials gave the bow more power than a wooden bow of the same size. Archers were able to keep their bows small enough to shoot easily while standing in a chariot without losing power.These military technologies were important because the Shang were constantly at war. A significant number of oracle bone inscriptions show that the Shang used chariots as mobile command vehicles and in royal hunts. Members of the royal household were often buried with a chariot, horses, and a charioteer. Shang armies expanded the borders of the kingdom and captured precious resources and prisoners of war, who could be enslaved or used as human sacrifices. The oracle bones also show deep concern over the ""barbarians"" living outside the empire, who were a constant threat to the safety and stability of the kingdom; the military had to be constantly ready to fight them.[Figure 7]Bronze Battle Axe Shang dynasty—1600 to 1046 BCE—Excavated at Yidu, Shangdong Province, 1956. This ax was used in hand-to-hand combat and was also a ritual object symbolizing power and military authority. The tomb it came from likely belonged to a man of wealth and influenceImagecourtesy of Wikipedia.The influence of the Early Shang extended hundreds of kilometers away from the capital, and many of the Shang bronze techniques diffused over large areas.The Shang, in turn, adopted skills, ideas, and even crops from some neighboring societies, such as wheat and axes, which may have come from Western Asia.^88start superscript, 8, end superscript,However—because natural barriers like the ocean, mountain ranges, deserts, and steppes kept the Shang in relative isolation—the Shang dynasty as well as later dynasties evolved in unique and insular ways.^99start superscript, 9, end superscriptPower and Social HierarchyThe Shang dynasty’s power was concentrated in many ancient cities, some of which have been unearthed by archaeologists. The first Shang ruler supposedly founded a new capital for his dynasty at a town called Shang, near modern-day Zhengzhou, a city of 2.6 million people in eastern China’s Henan Province. Archaeological remains of this town may have been found, and it seems to have functioned as a sacred capital where the most sacred temples and religious objects were housed. This city also had palaces, workshops, and city walls.Shang, along with other ancient Chinese cities, had two city walls—one inner and one outer wall. The common residents could live within the outer wall, but could not go past the inner wall, which enclosed a temple area, cemetery sites, bronze foundries, bronze casting areas, and bone workshops. The inner walls thus encircled an area of the political elite and craft specialists, who together were the engineers of the important ritual performances. In this way, the architecture of these cities was designed to separate different social classes.However, it seems that there were many capitals aside from this one, and rulers may have moved from one to the other because of religious rituals, military strategy, or food requirements. That suggests that the power of the dynasty was concentrated in the king, whose political authority was reinforced by the Shang religion.To consolidate their authority further, kings often went on excursions and military expeditions to walled towns outside the capitals where aristocrats had a lot of influence. Consolidating power in these areas was crucial, as control of peasant-farmed agricultural territories ensured sufficient resources for the inhabitants of the walled towns.[Figure 8]Major archaeological sites in north and central China dating from the second millennium BCEImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Anyang, another Shang capital, also in modern-day Henan Province, is another important—but slightly later—Shang city that has been excavated. It was located at the intersection between lowland agricultural areas of the North China Plain and mountains, which acted as a defensive border.This site yielded large numbers of oracle bones that describe the travels of eleven named kings. The names and timeframes of these kings match traditional lists of Shang kings. Anyang was a huge city, with an extensive cemetery of thousands of graves and 11 large tombs—evidence of the city's labor force, which may have belonged to the 11 Shang kings.Generally, Shang cities were not very well preserved in the archaeological record because of how they were built and the climate in northern China. Stone material was scarce, so the security of cities was reinforced by large walls made of compacted earth. Buildings were often constructed with dried mud over a framework of wooden posts. Cities were crucial to political and religious affairs, and they were the seats of administrative affairs, royal tombs, palaces, and shrines. Common people were concentrated in the agricultural areas outside the cities.The border territories of Shang rule were led by chieftains who gained the right to govern through connections with royalty. Shang relied heavily on neighboring fiefs for raw materials, much of which was devoted to ceremonial performances.Fiefswere lands given to social elites to govern on behalf of a more powerful ruler. The holder of a fief was expected to provide resources for political and military support to the ruler. Fiefs also had important economic roles; they often organized irrigation and flood control systems and supervised their construction.The Shang enacted afeudal system, a system in which duties are tied to land ownership, with sharp class divisions based on clan birthright. The aristocracy was centered aroundAnyang, which was the seat of governmental affairs for the surrounding areas. Regional territories farther from the capital were also controlled by the wealthy.After the kings and the aristocrats, the Shang military was next in social status and was respected and honored for their skill. There were two subdivisions of the military: the infantry (foot soldiers), and the chariot warriors. The latter were noted for their great skill in warfare and hunting.There were many local rulers who held hereditary titles. In this imperial system, elite classes benefitted from the production of peasants and large-scale projects under elite control, usually operated using various forms of unfree labor.There is also evidence of a class of proto-bureaucrats, many of whom were titled officials, who had managerial roles and kept extensive records. Their duties likely involved keeping an inventory of ritual materials, orchestrating ritual performances, managing large construction projects and bronze foundries, and tracking incoming tributes.Artisans and craftspeople comprised the middle class of Shang society. The rulers and aristocrats patronized these artisans in order to gain luxury goods for both personal consumption and ceremonial purposes.Their largest contribution was their work with bronze, particularly ritual vessels and treasures, many of which were discovered via archaeological findings in the 1920s and 1930s. Shang aristocrats and the royalty were likely buried with large numbers of bronze valuables, particularly wine vessels and other ornate structures.At the bottom of the social ladder were the peasants, the poorest of Chinese citizens. They comprised the majority of the population and were limited to farming and selling crops for profit in a constraining feudal system. Archaeological findings have shown that masses of peasants were buried with aristocrats, leading some scholars to believe that they were the equivalent of slaves. However, other scholars have countered that they may have been similar toserfs, who were tied to aristocrat-held land and gave aristocrats part of their harvest. Peasants were governed directly by local aristocrats. One of the ways that historians know about these social hierarchies is by examining cemeteries, which were often grouped in different neighborhoods and varied in quality according to the status of the people buried there.Shang ReligionShang religion was incredibly important, and it extended into the political and economic spheres. The Shang religion and state power were closely connected; state power was consolidated through a sense of reverence for royal Shang ancestors. Further, by the end of the Shang dynasty, the king was the only one who could interpret the oracle bones, thereby making him the head shaman.The Shang religion was characterized by a combination ofanimism, the idea that everything has a soul;shamanism, the belief in shamans who have the ability to communicate with the spiritual world; ancestor worship; and divination. Different gods represented natural and mythological symbols, such as the moon, the sun, the wind, the rain, the dragon, and the phoenix. Peasants prayed to these gods for bountiful harvests. Festivals to celebrate gods were also common.In particular, the Shang kings, who considered themselves divine rulers, consulted the great god Shangdi—the Supreme Being who ruled over humanity and nature—for advice and wisdom. The Shang believed that the ancestors could also confer good fortune; the Shang would consult ancestors through oracle bones in order to seek approval for any major decision and to learn about future success in harvesting, hunting, or battle.It appears that there was belief in the afterlife during the Shang dynasty. Archaeologists have found Shang tombs surrounded by the skulls and bodies of human sacrifices. Some of these containjade, which was thought to protect against decay and grant immortality. Archaeologists believe that Shang tombs were very similar to those found in the Egyptian pyramids in that they buried servants with them. Chinese archaeologists theorize that the Shang, like the ancient Egyptians, believed their servants would continue to serve them in the afterlife. Because of this belief, aristocrats' servants would be killed and buried with them when they died. Another interpretation is that these were enemy warriors captured in battle.One elaborate tombthathas been unearthed was that of Lady Hao, a consort of a Shang king who reigned around 1200 BCE. The artifacts found in her tomb indicate that she had a high social status and a great deal of power in Shang society, which makes historians speculate about the role of women in the Shang dynasty. Based on the artifacts found in Lady Hao’s tomb, it seems that she had her own wealth and political influence, and it is possible that she also had a prominent role in the military, as many bronze weapons were found buried with her.[Figure 9]Tomb of Lady Fu Hao, Yinxu, Henan, ChinaImagecourtesy Wikimedia Commons.Video AssignmentWatch:The Incredible History of China's Terracotta Warriorsby TED-EdWhat do the Terracotta Warriors tell us about Chinese history, their belief system, and what their emperors believed about the afterlife?Interactive Notebook AssignmentsConduct a SPICE analysis of ancientChina.Complete aS.P.I.C.E.chart and identify at least three characteristics for each category in the SPICE acronym.Create a Venn diagram of the major accomplishments of Ancient China.Summarize the significance of bronze in Shang society.Review QuestionsWhat characteristics make the Yellow River Valley Civilization a ""civilization""?What type of government do historians believe existed during the Shang dynasty?What hierarchies existed in Shang society?How did geography influence the development of the Yellow River Valley Civilization?How didhumansimpact theenvironmentalong the Yellow River Valley?Vocabularydynastya series of rulers  from a single familyShang dynastythe first historically confirmed dynasty which supposedly began when the Shang overthrew the Xia sometime around 1760 BCEZhou dynastyaChinese dynastythat followed the Shang dynastylasting longer than any other dynasty in Chinese historyoracle bonesthe oldest surviving form of Chinese writing found as inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animalsfiefslands given to social elites to govern on behalf of a more powerful ruler.

Its beliefs were written down forming a large canon. Buddhist images were also devised to be worshiped in sacred spaces. From India, Buddhism spread throughout Asia. In order to appreciate the magnitude of the Buddha's achievement, we should try to imagine what life was like in early India, particularly in towns and villages of the Ganges River Valley—like Kapilavastu in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains—in what is now the country of Nepal. This is the area in which the Buddha was likely born, in about 560 BCE Every year the river flooded the valley destroying crops. Monsoons came every year too, creating famine. There were also severe droughts and disease such as dysentery and cholera.The Brahmin, (the Hindu priests) chanted the Vedic hymns (the oldest scriptures of Hinduism) and offered fire sacrifices to Brahma (the Hindu god of creation). However, they did not improve conditions for the common man. From the earliest times, Hindu society was stratified. Castes were firmly established in the economy with the Brahmin as the creators and perpetuators of a social order highly favorable to themselves.Image by Chris Shervey on Flickr licensed under CC BY 2.0.ChinaTowards the end of the Zhou Dynasty, as feudal lords squabbled over land holdings, a scholar and government minister by the name of Kong Fuzi—later latinized asConfuciusby sixteenth-century Jesuits—gained students and followers as he taught the classics: the ancient Zhou-eraBook of Documents, theBook of Odes, andThe Book of Changes, a fortune-teller's text better known by its Han Dynasty name: theI Ching.These texts were already ancient in Confucius's time. The respect that Confucius accorded them is perfectly in-line with his philosophy offilial piety, or near-religious respect for your parents or elders. Fundamentally,Confucianismis a philosophy of respect for the past. While little of Confucius’s original language survives, TheAnalects of Confucius—meaning literallyThe Gathered up Sayingsof Confucius—was composed by his students and followers based on conversations they had with him.  Confucius urged ethical and upright behavior, framing responsible government as a moral duty similar to parenthood. He believed providing a good example of moral conduct to the people would spur them to act within the confines of the law.  Confucianism presents the idea that people can be made good if they follow moral instruction and perform rituals that venerate the gods and honor the ancestral dead. In a time of social upheaval and war, the Confucianists believed only careful maintenance of the old forms could uphold societal unity.[Figure 3]""Wong Tai Sin Temple: Prayers"" by Andrew Moore on Flickr licensed under CC BY 2.0.LegalismDuring the Warring States Period of Chinese history, from 475 to 221 BCE, what we now think of today as China was divided into seven competing nations. The dukedoms and fiefs that had swelled in importance during the end of the Zhou Dynasty had now become states of their own.  One of those seven states was the state of Qin, whose young ruler, King Zheng, would later become Qin Shi Huang, the first ruler of the Qin Dynasty, in 221 BCE. But let's rewind the tape about a century and a half. If we want to understandLegalism, the ideology that explains Qin Shi Huang's despotism and centralized rule, we have to go back toShang Yang, a reformist statesman from the state of Qin. Lord Shang's understanding of humanity was profoundly different from Confucius's.DaoismWhere Confucianism and Legalism both required strict adherence to principles, whether they were enforcement-based Legalist ones or shame-based Confucian ones,Daoismrecognizes no law but theDao, the way.Daoism is a kind of anti-activism: it asserts that the best life is one of willful ignorance, seeking no knowledge and avoiding involvement in politics or public life. The Dao is meant to represent the natural order of the universe, and Daoism stipulates that human beings are the only species that disobeys the Dao. Rather than seek to elevate oneself through words and deeds, Daoists cultivated a practice ofwu wei, orinaction: giving in to thoughtless, effortless, and natural action.Daoists believe that if all people ceased striving for glory, riches, and attainment, there would be no war, no envy, and lessened suffering. Daoism colored many elements of later Chinese philosophy and would later come to influence Buddhism as it made its way to China along the Silk Road. Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism all each played a role during the Warring States Period. These three philosophies influenced the styles of Chinese governance throughout the Qin ascendancy, the Han dynasty, and beyond, becoming more or less influential depending on which dynasty was in power.IsraelJudaism is a monotheistic religion that emerged with the Israelites in the Eastern Mediterranean within the context of the Mesopotamian river valley civilizations. The Israelites were but one nomadic tribe from the area, so named because they considered themselves to be the descendants of Jacob, who changed his name to Israel.Judaism stems from a collection of stories that explain the origins of the ""children of Israel"" and the laws that their deity commanded of them. the stories explain how the Israelites came to settle, construct a Temple for their one God, and eventually established a monarchy - as divinely instructed - in the ancient Land of Israel. Over centuries, the Israelites' literature, history, and laws were compiled and edited into a series of texts, now often referred to in secular contests as the Hebrew Bible written between the eleventh century BCE and the sixth century BCE. The Hebrew Bible contains three major sections: the Torah, or Five Books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Writings.The Dome of the Rock is a shrine located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It was initially completed in 691 CE at the order of Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna. The Dome of the Rock is now one of the oldest works of Islamic architecture. It has been called ""Jerusalem's most recognisable landmark"". Its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces.The octagonal plan of the structure may also have been influenced by the Byzantine Chapel of St Mary (also known as Kathisma and al-Qadismu) built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. ""Dome of The Rock, Jerusalem"" by Ray in Manila on Flickr licensed under CC by 2.0.GreeceAncient Greece was comprised of hundreds of essentially independent city-states, partly due to the geography of Greece. Communities were separated by mountains, hills, and water. Rather than a unified nation, Ancient Greece was more like a network of communities with a shared religion and language that sometimes led to a sense of common belonging.  Despite these cultural commonalities, affiliations between city-states were loose and short-lived. The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues, for example, were dominated by one strong city-state. Another good example is how conflict with Persia prompted several city-states to unify against a common enemy, but not all Greek city-states were involved; further, once the external threat was diminished, conflict between the city-states resumed.In the ancient Greek world, religion was personal, direct, and present in all areas of life. It revolved around myths which explained the origins of mankind and gave the gods a human face. Temples dominated the urban landscape and city festivals and national sporting and artistic competitions were frequent, so religion was never far from the mind of an ancient Greek. Individuals in Greek society probably had varying degrees of religious belief - and some may have been skeptics - but Greek society could only have functioned as it did were it not for the fact that certain fundamentals were generally accepted throughout society: the gods existed, they could influence human affairs, and they welcomed and responded to acts of piety and worship.[Figure 5]""Atlas"" by Gabriela Fab on Flickr licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.RomeThe Romans did not set out any deliberate plan to build an empire. Instead, Rome expanded as it came into conflict with surrounding city-states, kingdoms, and empires and had to create ways to incorporate these new territories and populations. The Romans did not try to turn everyone they conquered into a Roman. For the most part, cities and regions that came under Roman control were allowed to maintain their existing cultural and political institutions. The only major requirement that Rome imposed on its defeated enemies was that they provide soldiers for military campaigns. In the ancient world, military victory usually meant a share of the loot taken from the conquered, so participating on the winning side of a conflict offered incentives to Rome’s new allies.Most conquered enemies were offered some level of Roman citizenship, sometimes with full voting rights. Because a person had to be physically present in Rome to vote, the extension of voting rights beyond the population of the city itself did not drastically alter the political situation in Rome. However, the offer of citizenship did help to build a sense of shared identity around loyalty to Rome.In order to manage the new territories that came under their influence, the Romans created formal provinces and appointed former political officeholders to manage them. Given the distance between most provinces and Rome, these governors often had considerable power and flexibility in dealing with local issues. The Romans tried to create a balance between giving governors enough power to control their provinces and preventing governors from becoming so powerful that they could challenge Rome's authority.Rome became the most powerful state in the world by the first century BCE through a combination of military power, political flexibility, economic expansion, and more than a bit of good luck. This expansion changed the Mediterranean world and also changed Rome itself. New institutions, such as provincial government, were created to deal with the management of empire; culture was transformed as outside influences, especially from Greece, came into fashion in Rome; and the city itself was physically transformed by the influx of loot and people brought by successes abroad.[Figure 6]""Roman Baths"" by John Cooke on Flickr licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0. Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset, UKPersiaCyrus was a successful military commander, but he also recognized the need to leave the regions that he conquered in good economic order if they were going to provide him with tribute revenues. To achieve this, Cyrus left local rulers in place after conquering a region, and he allowed the local population to continue practicing their preferred religious traditions. These policies ensured that conquered regions continued to function economically and reduced the chance that they would rebel against him.In ancient Mesopotamia, a common imperial strategy was to relocate conquered populations to new areas in order to break up their political and cultural unity and make them less dangerous to the ruling power. Cyrus reversed this practice by allowing the Jews, who had been relocated by the Babylonians, to return to Israel and establish a tributary state. While this might appear to be an act of generosity, it was probably a calculated move on the part of Cyrus to help ensure Jewish loyalty, and thus a continuation of his general policy of tolerance.Like most ancient rulers, Darius used religion to justify his power. He claimed that the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, had appointed him to rule the world. To emphasize his power over his appointed satraps—and also to demonstrate that he was ruler of a diverse empire, rather than of a single kingdom or people—he took the title ofShahanshah, King of Kings. The idea here was to avoid the appearance of favoring a particular group or region within the empire.[Figure 7]""Tomb of Xerxes I"" by A.

Their weight and composition even give evidence of trade with other ancient civilizations. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.Peaceful coexistence of diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups has historically been a hallmark of South Asian cultures. For this reason, many have referred to the region as a ""salad bowl"" of culture: a hodgepodge of different peoples, beliefs, and behaviors.In South Asia — which includes the land that makes up the modern-day nations of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka — colorful distinctions are apparent and even celebrated.[Figure 2]When India crashed into Asia 50 million years ago, the collision created the Himalayan Mountains and made India a subcontinent. Image courtesy of ushistory.org licensed under CC BY 4.0.Under the layers of diversity lies a solid core of South Asian tradition. Traditions have endured for more than 5,000 years — from the earliest known Indian civilization to the present day.The Indus Valley civilization dates back to about 3000 BCE. The archaeological evidence from this period provides exemplary evidence that many aspects of South Asian culture have endured through changing times.Remnants of ancient bathhouses and sophisticated sanitation systems point to the long history of South Asian culture — admiration of purity and cleanliness, and abhorrence of all things polluted. Ancient statues representing the god Shiva are proof that the religious traditions of today's South Asia, too, have been around for millennia.The Soul of South AsiaTo understand the history and cultures of ancient South Asia, it is essential to consider the development of Hinduism and Buddhism. These two religions encompassed far more than spirituality. They became the lifeblood of the people and the backbone of social, political, and economic structures. These religions pervaded all aspects of life and shaped the evolution of the region.[Figure 3]The ancient Indians built religious monuments dedicated to many faiths. Many are visited by pilgrims today, such as this Buddhist temple in Nalanda. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Some have called Hinduism the ""soul of India."" One of the most powerful and influential developments of ancient Hinduism was the institution of the caste system. The caste system became deeply incorporated into Hindu tradition and created an enduring framework of ascribed social status.Buddhism emerged as a rejection of the injustices created by the caste system sanctioned by Hinduism. It was a response to discontentment and a search for new answers to the mysterious and complex questions that define human experience.Organized power structures arose from the conflict and confusion that followed the growth of new religions and the challenging of social structures. These power structures led to the formation of state systems and even triggered the development of vast empires.Few regions in the world have histories as ancient and diverse as South Asia's. And few people realize that South Asia's roots can be traced to the beginnings of human civilization. Marked by integration, intellectualism, and spirituality, South Asia's ancient history begs to be explored.Early Civilization in the Indus ValleyAryans probably used the Khyber Pass to cross the mountains during their Indian invasion. Located in present day Pakistan, the pass is about 16 yards wide at its narrowest point. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The phrase ""early civilizations usually conjures up images of Egypt and Mesopotamia, and their pyramids, mummies, and gold.But in the 1920s, a huge discovery in South Asia proved that Egypt and Mesopotamia were not the only ""early civilizations."" In the vast Indus River plains (located in what is today Pakistan and western India), under layers of land and mounds of dirt, archaeologists discovered the remains of a 4,600 year-old city. A thriving, urban civilization had existed at the same time as Egyptian and Mesopotamian states — in an area twice each of their sizes.The people of this Indus Valley civilization did not build massive monuments like their contemporaries, nor did they bury riches among their dead in golden tombs. There were no mummies, no emperors, and no violent wars or bloody battles in their territory.Remarkably, the lack of all these is what makes the Indus Valley civilization so exciting and unique. While others civilizations were devoting huge amounts of time and resources to the rich, the supernatural, and the dead, Indus Valley inhabitants were taking a practical approach to supporting the common, secular, living people. Sure, they believed in an afterlife and employed a system of social divisions, but they also believed resources were more valuable in circulation among the living than on display or buried underground.The ""Great Bath"" of Mohenjo-Daro is the earliest known public water tank of the ancient world. Most scholars believe that this tank would have been used in conjunction with religious ceremonies. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Amazingly, the Indus Valley civilization appears to have been a peaceful one. Very few weapons have been found and no evidence of an army has been discovered.Excavated human bones reveal no signs of violence, and building remains show no indication of battle. All evidence points to a preference for peace and success in achieving it.So how did such a practical and peaceful civilization become so successful?The Twin CitiesThe ruins of two ancient cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro (both in modern-day Pakistan), and the remnants of many other settlements, have revealed great clues to this mystery. Harappa was, in fact, such a rich discovery that the Indus Valley Civilization is also called the Harappan civilization.Seals such as these were used by merchants in the Harappan civilization. Many experts believe that they signified names. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The first artifact uncovered in Harappa was a unique stone seal carved with a unicorn and an inscription. Similar seals with different animal symbols and writings have since been found throughout the region. Although the writing has not yet been deciphered, the evidence suggests they belonged to the same language system. Apparently, Mesopotamia's cuneiform system had some competition in the race for the world's first script.The discovery of the seals prompted archaeologists to dig further. Amazing urban architecture was soon uncovered across the valley and into the western plains. The findings clearly show that Harappan societies were well organized and very sanitary.This copy of the Rig Veda was written after the Vedic Age. The Aryans had no form of writing at the time they invaded India. Instead, these religious scripts would have been memorized and passed down orally by Brahman priests. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.For protection from seasonal floods and polluted waters, the settlements were built on giant platforms and elevated grounds. Upon these foundations, networks of streets were laid out in neat patterns of straight lines and right angles. The buildings along the roads were all constructed of bricks that were uniform in size.The brick houses of all city dwellers were equipped with bathing areas supplied with water from neighborhood wells. Sophisticated drainage systems throughout the city carried dirty water and sewage outside of living spaces. Even the smallest houses on the edges of the towns were connected to the systems — cleanliness was obviously of utmost importance.The Fall of Harappan CultureNo doubt, these cities were engineering masterpieces of their time. The remains of their walls yield clues about the culture that thrived in the Indus Valley. Clay figurines of goddesses, for example, are proof that religion was important. Toys and games show that even in 3000 BCE, kids — and maybe even adults — liked to play. Pottery, textiles, and beads are evidence of skilled craftsmanship and thriving trade.The swastika was a sacred symbol for the Aryans signifying prosperity. The word comes from the Sanskrit for ""good fortune."" Hitler borrowed the symbol, changed the angle and direction of the arms, and used it to represent the Nazis. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.It was this intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade that allowed the Harappan culture to spread widely and prosper greatly. Each time goods were traded or neighbors entered the gates of the cities to barter, Indus culture was spread.Eventually, though, around 1900 BCE, this prosperity came to an end. The integrated cultural network collapsed, and the civilization became fragmented into smaller regional cultures. Trade, writing, and seals all but disappeared from the area.Many believe that the decline of the Harappan civilization was a result of Aryan invasions from the north. This theory seems logical because the Aryans came to power in the Ganges Valley shortly after the Indus demise of the Indus Valley Civilization. Because there is little evidence of any type of invasion though, numerous historians claim that it was an environmental disaster that led to the civilization's demise. They argue that changing river patterns disrupted the farming and trading systems and eventually led to irreparable flooding.Although the intricate details of the early Indus Valley culture might never be fully known, many pieces of the ancient puzzle have been discovered. The remains of the Indus Valley cities continue to be unearthed and interpreted today. With each new artifact, the history of early Indian civilization is strengthened and the legacy of this ingenious and diverse metropolis is made richer.The Caste SystemIf a Hindu person were asked to explain the nature of the caste system, he or she might start to tell the story of Brahma — the four-headed, four-handed deity worshipped as the creator of the universe.These girls, who belong to the Untouchable caste, make dung patties, which are used for fuel and heat by members of all the castes. This job was considered so unclean that other castes did not associate with the members of society that performed it. ""Harijan Girls"" by Carolyn Brown Heinz courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.According to an ancient text known as the Rigveda, the division of Indian society was based on Brahma's divine manifestation of four groups.Priests and teachers were cast from his mouth, rulers and warriors from his arms, merchants and traders from his thighs, and workers and peasants from his feet.What does ""Caste"" Mean?Even today, most Indian languages use the term ""jati"" for the system of hereditary social structures in South Asia. When Portuguese travelers to 16th-century India first encountered what appeared to them to be race-based social stratification, they used the Portuguese term ""casta"" — which means ""race"" — to describe what they saw. Today, the term ""caste"" is used to describe stratified societies based on hereditary groups not only in South Asia but throughout the world.Although born into the Kshatriya caste, Mahatma Gandhi spent much of his life working to bring the Untouchables equality. It was Gandhi who first named the Untouchables ""Harijans,"" meaning ""children of God."" Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Others might present a biological explanation of India's stratification system, based on the notion that all living things inherit a particular set of qualities. Some inherit wisdom and intelligence, some get pride and passion, and others are stuck with less fortunate traits. Proponents of this theory attribute all aspects of one's lifestyle — social status, occupation, and even diet — to these inherent qualities and thus use them to explain the foundation of the caste system.The Origins of the Caste SystemAccording to one long-held theory about the origins of South Asia's caste system, Aryans from central Asia invaded South Asia and introduced the caste system as a means of controlling the local populations. The Aryans defined key roles in society, then assigned groups of people to them. individuals were born into, worked, married, ate, and died within those groups. There was no social mobility.The Aryan MythBut 20th-century scholarship has thoroughly disproved this theory. Most scholars believe that there was no Aryan invasion from the north. In fact, some even believe that the Aryans — if they did exist — actually originated in South Asia and spread from there to Europe. Regardless of who the Aryans were or where they lived, it is generally agreed that they did not single-handedly create South Asia's caste system.Thus, it has been impossible to determine the exact origins of the caste system in South Asia. In the midst of the debate, only one thing is certain: South Asia's caste system has been around for several millennia and, until the second half of the 20th century, has changed very little.Time for ClassIn ancient India, the ranked occupational groups were referred to asvarnas, and the hereditary occupational groups within thevarnaswere known asjatis.Many have immediately assumed that ascribed social groups and rules prohibiting intermarriage among the groups signify the existence of a racist culture. But this assumption is false.Varnasare not racial groups but rather classes.Fourvarnacategories were constructed to organize society along economic and occupational lines. Spiritual leaders and teachers were called Brahmins. Warriors and nobility were called Kshatriyas. Merchants and producers were called Vaishyas. Laborers were called Sudras.The UntouchablesIn addition to thevarnas,there is a fifth class in Hinduism. It encompassed outcasts who, literally, did all the dirty work. They were referred to as ""untouchables"" because they carried out the miserable tasks associated with disease and pollution, such as cleaning up after funerals, dealing with sewage, and working with animal skin.Brahmins were considered the embodiment of purity, and untouchables the embodiment of pollution. Physical contact between the two groups was absolutely prohibited. Brahmins adhered so strongly to this rule that they felt obliged to bathe if even the shadow of an untouchable fell across them.""The Caste System in India"" by Manmohan Dash, courtesy of Invariance Publishing House, licensed under CC BY-ND 3.0.Struggling against TraditionAlthough the political and social force of the caste system has not disappeared completely, the Indian government has officially outlawed caste discrimination and made widespread reforms. Particularly through the efforts of Indian nationalists such as Mohandas Gandhi, rules preventing social mobility and cross-caste mingling have been loosened.Gandhi renamed the untouchablesHarijans, which means ""the people of God."" Adopted in 1949, the Indian Constitution provided a legal framework for the emancipation of untouchables and for the equality of all citizens.In recent years, the Untouchables have become a politically active group and have adopted for themselves the name Dalits, which means ""those who have been broken.""The Rise of HinduismDharma. Karma. Reincarnation.Brahma. Shiva. Vishnu.Not many things have endured without interruption or major transformation for over 5,000 years. Hindu traditions such as these are great exceptions. Arguably, Hinduism is the oldest religion on Earth.Each of the three main Hindu deities represents a part of the life cycle: Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer. Upon destruction, Hindus believe that the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction begins again. ""Hindu Trinity"" courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.To understand how Hinduism has withstood the tests of time, it is important to know the principles upon which it is grounded. And to understand the principles, it is necessary to know their historical foundations.Archaeologists have determined that highly developed civilizations flourished throughout the Indus Valley between 4000 and 1500 BCE. But for still unknown reasons, the valley's inhabitants appear to have moved out rather suddenly. They resettled among new neighbors in northwestern India and encountered a group of people from central Asia who brought with them warrior ethics and a religion called Vedism.Within the ruins of the ancient Indus Valley civilization, archaeologists have discovered many artifacts of modern Hinduism that were not found in any Vedic civilizations. These include statues and amulets of gods and goddesses, huge temple tanks for bathing, and sculptures of people in yoga postures.Based on this evidence, it seems that when the people from central Asia settled in India, their Vedic beliefs were mingled with the beliefs of indigenous Indians. Thus, it is likely that the Indus Valley tradition and Vedic gods and beliefs combined to form the foundations of Hinduism.There is a trinity for Hindu goddesses as well as for gods. Laxmi, the second goddess of the trinity (shown here) is the goddess of wealth. The consort of Vishnu, she was incarnated on earth as the wife of each one of his avatars, exemplifying the devotion of a Hindu wife. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.One Faith, Many PathsHinduism stands apart from all other religions for several reasons. It has no single founder, no single book of theological law and truth, no central religious organization, and no definition of absolute beginning and end.Hinduism is a code of life — a collection of attitudes, personal experiences, and spiritual practices. It is, in essence, defined by behaviors rather than beliefs.According to Hindu philosophy, there is one divine reality, and all religions are simply various interpretations of it. Because of this, Hinduism allows and even encourages individuals to choose a religious path that best suits their social, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual needs.One Hindu devotee might worship well-known gods such as Vishnu and Shiva in a large, public temple, whereas another might worship less common deities in a private shrine within his or her own home. Yet they would both be considered good Hindus, provided that they honored each other's choices.This tolerance makes Hinduism difficult to understand and define, but it does explain why so many gods, goddesses, and rituals are described in the numerous Hindu scriptures.The Vedas and the UpanishadsDespite the fact that Hindus characteristically believe and do different things, several concepts and traditions bind them together. Many of these beliefs were compiled in a set of scriptures written around 1300 BCE known as the Vedas. It is believed that the Vedas are the eternal truths that were heard, then written down by holy seers.According to the Vedas, time and life are cyclical. After death, one's soul leaves the body and is reborn, or reincarnated, into a new form.The Ramayana, a classic epic in the Hindu religion, tells the story of Rama and the 7th avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, the preserver of life. This picture shows Rama breaking the bow of Shiva, winning a contest as well as his wife Sita's hand in marriage. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The constant cycle of birth and rebirth is known assamsaraand the measurement by which the quality of new birth is determined is known as karma. Karma, the accumulated result of one's actions in various lives, can be good or bad. Righteous and moral conduct, known as dharma, is the road to good karma.Examples of traditional good conduct included marrying within one's caste, revering upper castes, doing good deeds, and abstaining from meat, particularly that of cows.The writings known as the Upanishads appeared600to800years after the Vedas and focus mostly on how to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Upanishads explain how to leave Samsara through a release and ultimate enlightenment known asmoksha. The appearance of the Upanishads marked the beginning of a period known as the Vedantic Age.The End of the Vedas?Literally, 'Vedantic"" means ""end of the Vedas."" But the Vedic beliefs never really disappeared. Gods of the Vedic tradition became less commonly worshipped, but the Vedic philosophies recorded in the books were surely not forgotten. The principles of karma and dharma were too popular (especially among members of the lower castes) to fade away.Scholars continue to debate over the beginning of Hinduism, but most agree that during the Vedantic Age (between 800 and 400 BCE) there was a shift to the widespread worship of the gods Vishnu and Shiva. They also agree that this shift coincided with the emergence of new religions in India that sought enlightenment, such as Buddhism and Jainism.In the years to come, Hinduism became divided into many sects, but true to the foundations of Hinduism, the new sects' beliefs and practices were accepted. Because of such tolerance, Hinduism thrives today, millennia after it began.The Birth and Spread of BuddhismWhat is humanity's place within the universe?For millennia, people around the world have asked this question. In 6th-century South Asia, this question stirred up a small revolution.The Buddha preached his first sermon at Sarnath, shown here. He believed that freedom from desires set people free from the cycle of rebirth. The Buddha preached his first sermon at Sarnath, shown here. He believed that freedom from desires set people free from the cycle of rebirth. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The answers provided by traditional Hindu teachings and practices made Indian philosophers and religious sages increasingly upset. Many members of the Vaishya class spoke against the injustices of the Hindu caste system and the overwhelming power of the priestly class, known as the Brahmins.Many Brahmin priests were considered corrupt because they performed animal sacrifices and practiced other Vedic rituals. Resentment of such rituals and continued anger about unbalanced social power prompted the development of new intellectual teachings and philosophies. These new ideas maintained that some aspects of Hindu tradition and ritual had merit. They never directly challenged Vedic gods or beliefs.But Siddharta Gautama did.Buddha: Spiritual RevelationSiddharta was born about 563 BCE in the foothills of the Himalayas. A prince, he lived a sheltered life amid luxury, wealth, and comfort, but at age 29, Siddharta fled from his palace and discovered something new.For the first time, he saw poverty, misery, and illness. At home, he soon felt discontented with his materialistic life and the conditions that surrounded him. In response to the emotions triggered by his experience outside the palace, he gave away all his belongings and searched for enlightenment through the abandonment of basic needs.Siddharta began his quest with a period of starvation. According to legend, he grew so thin during this time that he could feel his hands if he placed one on the small of his back and the other on his stomach. These methods of self-denial eventually led him to a revelation.Siddharta Gautama was a prince in a kingdom near the present day border of India and Nepal. Upon his enlightenment, his followers began to call him Buddha, which means, ""Enlightened One."" Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Siddharta discovered that he needed to find another way — something in between his rich and impoverished lifestyles. He resolved to follow the Middle Path.Siddharta sought enlightenment through concentration. He sat under a pipal tree, practiced intense meditation, and fought off all worldly temptations. After 40 days, he reached the ultimate goal — nirvana.He came to understand his previous lives and finally gained release from the cycle of suffering. When he attained Enlightenment, he became known by the title of Buddha, or ""Awakened One.""The Buddha set out to share his experience and to teach others to follow the Middle Path. He traveled throughout northeastern India for several decades, spreading his philosophy to anyone who was interested, regardless of gender or caste. Even Brahmins and members of the nobility were converted.The Buddha died in 483 BCE, after 45 years of traveling and teaching. Upon his death, the Buddha passed into a state of nirvana, the ultimate release from suffering in which the self no longer exists and salvation is achieved. Included in his last breaths were four words of inspiration: ""Strive on with awareness,"" and his followers did.Buddhism: Spiritual RevolutionSmall communities of monks and nuns, known asbhikkus, sprung up along the roads that Buddha traveled. Devoted to his teachings, they dressed in yellow robes and wandered the countryside to meditate quietly. For almost 200 years, these humble disciples were overshadowed by the dominant Hindu believers, but the rise of a great empire changed all that.In the third century BCE, several ambitious leaders built the expansive Mauryan empire and fought many bloody battles were fought to extend its boundaries of control. One king, named Ashoka, was so troubled by the effects of the conquests on humanity that he converted to Buddhism. Adopting a code of nonviolence, he renounced all warfare and incorporated principles of Buddhism in his ruling practices.Ashoka promoted Buddhist expansion by sending monks to surrounding territories to share the teachings of the Buddha. A wave of conversion began, and Buddhism spread not only through India, but also internationally. Ceylon, Burma, Nepal, Tibet, central Asia, China, and Japan are just some of the regions where the Middle Path was widely accepted.With the great spread of Buddhism, traditional practices and philosophies became redefined and regionally distinct. Only a small minority practiced the earliest forms of Buddhism, and Buddhist influence as a whole began to fade within India. Some scholars believe that many Buddhist practices were simply absorbed into the tolerant Hindu faith.Today there are approximately 350 million Buddhists in the world.The Gupta Period of IndiaThe Ajanta and Ellora caves were created during the Golden Age. They were decorated with paintings of religious figures; some Hindu and some Buddhist. ""Amanita Cave Painting"" courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The Gupta Period of India was not characterized by enormous material wealth or by elaborate trade activity.It was defined by creativity. Flourishing arts, fabulous literature, and stupendous scholars are just a few of the things that marked the period.In 185 BCE, the Mauryan empire collapsed when the last of the Mauryan kings was assassinated. In its place, small kingdoms arose throughout India.For nearly 500 years, the various states warred with each other. In the northern territories, a new empire arose when a ruler named Chandragupta I ascended the throne in 320 CE. He revived many principles of Mauryan government and paved the way for his son, Samudragupta, to develop an extensive empire.Victory at Any CostSamudragupta was a great warrior and conquest was his passion. He sought to unite all of India under his rule and quickly set out to achieve this goal by waging wars across much of the Indian subcontinent.Hoping for mercy, many potential victims offered tribute and presents to Samudragupta as he swept through the territories. But little mercy was granted. One by one, he defeated nine kings in the north and twelve in the south. In addition to the human devastation countless horses were slaughtered to celebrate his victories.The Gupta territories expanded so greatly under Samudragupta's reign that he has often been compared to great conquerors such as Alexander the Great and Napoleon. But of course he did not achieve military success singlehandedly. Local squads — each consisting of one elephant, one chariot, three armed cavalrymen, and five foot soldiers — protected Gupta villages from raids and revolts. In times of war, the squads joined together to form a powerful royal army.Gupta AchievementsBut Samudragupta was more than a fighter; he was also a lover of the arts. Engraved coins and inscribed pillars from the time of his reign provide evidence of both his artistic talent and his patronage. He set the stage for the emergence of classical art, which occurred under the rule of his son and successor Chandragupta II.Chandragupta II gave great support to the arts. Artists were so highly valued under his rule that they were paid for their work — a rare phenomenon in ancient civilizations. Perhaps it is due to this monetary compensation that such considerable progress was made in literature and science during the period.Nalanda University was founded during India's Golden Age. This center of Buddhist learning was built in a place that the Buddha himself had visited a number of times, and was patronized by the Gupta kings. ""Nalanda University"" courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Much of the literature produced during the Gupta dynasty was poetry and drama. Narrative histories, religious and meditative writing, and lyric poetry emerged to enrich, educate, and entertain the people. Formal essays were composed on subjects ranging from grammar and medicine to math and astronomy. The best known essay of the period is theKamasutra, which provides rules about the art of love and marriage according to Hindu laws.Two of the most famous scholars of the era were Kalidasa and Aryabhatta. Kalidasa, the greatest writer of the empire, brought plays to new heights by filling them with humor and epic heroism. Aryabhatta, a scientist ahead of his time, went out on a limb and proposed that earth was a rotating sphere centuries before Columbus made his famous voyage. Aryabhatta also calculated the length of the solar year as 365.358 days — only three hours over the figure calculated by modern scientists.Alongside these scholarly achievements, magnificent architecture, sculpture, and painting also developed. Among the greatest paintings of this period are those that were found on the walls of the Ajanta Caves in the plains of southern India. The paintings illustrate the various lives of the Buddha. An 18-foot statue of the Hindu god Shiva was also found within a Gupta-dynasty rock temple near Bombay.A Lasting InspirationAlthough the Gupta rulers practiced Hindu rituals and traditions, it is clear from these discoveries that the empire was characterized by religious freedom. Evidence of a Buddhist university within the region is further proof of the peaceful coexistence between Hindus and Buddhists.The Gupta dynasty flourished immensely under Chandragupta II, but rapidly weakened during the reign of his two successors. A wave of invasions launched by the Huns, a nomadic group from central Asia, started in 480 CE. Two decades later, Gupta kings had little territory left under their control. Around 550 CE, the empire perished completely.Though India was not truly unified again until the coming of the Muslims, the classical culture of the Guptas did not disappear. The flourishing arts of the region, which were unrivaled in their time, left more than a legacy. They left descendants of the Guptas with continuous inspiration to create.Video AssignmentWatch:The Indus Valley Civilizationby Crash Course World HistoryWhat are 4 symptoms of civilization?Why did the first civilizations arise near river valleys?What are the accomplishments of the Indus Valley Civilization?Why did the Indus Valley Civilization come to an end?Interactive Notebook AssignmentsExplain two innovations that were specific to the Indus Valley Civilizations.Identify the twin cities of Ancient India.Compare the conflicting theories on the decline of Harappan civilization.Describe the different social classes created by the Aryan Caste.Explain who Siddharta Gautama was and his idea of the ""middle path""Explain how Ashoka rose to power and helped spread Buddhist beliefs outside of India.Compare and contrast the Mauryan and Gupta Empires.ReviewQuestionsWhat were the key religious ideas that originated in India that continue to draw adherents in the present?How did Buddhism address human suffering?What were the Buddha's four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path?How did the caste system operate to establish social order in India?What were the innovations and accomplishments of the classical Indian Mauryan and Gupta empires?VocabularyAryansAn Indo-European people who migrated into the Indian subcontinent around 1500 B.C.

[WH.16C]Classical China[Figure 2]When 13-year-old Qin Emperor Shi Huangdi came to power in 221 BCE, one of his first acts was to begin preparing for his death. In addition to his army of over 8,000 clay soldiers, his tomb was lined in bronze and contained a vast wealth of jewels and artifacts beyond imagination. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.In 1974, researchers uncovered the tomb of Shi Huangdi, the legendary Ch'in (Qin) emperor who unified China and reigned from 221-207 BCE. Inside of the tomb were life-sized soldiers made of terracotta (Italian for ""baked earth""), lined up neatly in 38 rows. The soldiers were amazing in their detail, with each having different facial features, likely modeled after actual soldiers. They even carried real bronze weapons, with blades that remained razor sharp after 2,200 years.To live forever. That was the goal of ancient Chinese Taoists. They pursued it through many different means including alchemy, diet, gymnastics, and breathing methods. ""The Quest for Immortality"" courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.However, what truly left archaeologists and the rest of the world watching on TV in awe was this: There were more than 8,000 soldiers lined up in the tomb! Infantrymen, chariots pulled by life-sized clay horses, crossbowmen; it was a complete army, armed and armored. Stretching 650 feet back into the chamber, these soldiers were created to guard the emperor in the afterlife. Ordered by the emperor at age 13, it took 36 years and 700,000 workers to complete construction of the massive tomb and its army.A Lesson in ParadoxesChinese history is a lesson in paradoxes. Their past is full of natural disasters and wars, yet some of the most beautiful art, literature, and architecture have been created and preserved through the 13 dynastic periods, spanning 4,000 years into the 20th century. These trends are reflected by three of the most influential dynasties of China: the Shang, Han, and Tang.Written language began in China with the oracle bones and tortoise shells of the Shang dynasty, and the beauty of their bronze work was unrivaled for hundreds of years. The Han dynasty will always be remembered for opening up to the Western world through its use of the Silk Road. Ideas such asBuddhismwere exchanged as freely as silk and spices with lands as far west as India and the Roman Empire.A little over a decade ago, researchers found the perfectly preserved bodies of a band of travelers migrating through the bleak western deserts of China. What made this find startling was that the mummies were European, with pale faces and reddish hair. Could this signal the discovery of a new civilization? Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.China's most enduring landmark, the Great Wall, was started by the Qin dynasty but was built primarily during the Han period. Its earthen walls protected the Chinese people from foreign invasions throughout the centuries. It was during the Tang dynasty that the most beautiful poetry of dynastic China was written, as were the civil examinations that remained in use into the 20th century. China was, and is, truly a land of invention and discovery.The major philosophies originating in China, Taoism and Confucianism, will be examined in the hope that we may learn from their vast wealth of knowledge. Brilliant thinkers such as Lao Tzu and Confucius molded the political and religious landscapes of dynastic China with their radical ideas about the nature of man.The Middle KingdomTo prevent flooding of the north China plain by the Yellow River, Yu the Great organized large scale projects in irrigation and dike-building. Yu then went on to found the first dynasty of China, the Xia. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.From the misty veil of prehistory emerged the myths of ancient China. Heroes turned to gods, and men and beasts performed miraculous feats. Their myths explain the discoveries of the tools and practices used by the Chinese to the present day.Yet Chinese mythology has never contained any clear-cut creation stories. The people of China existed long before creation myths became popular. Instead, the earliest Chinese myths center on issues that everyday people had to face. One example involves a man named Yu.The Legend of YuFlooding worried Emperor Shun. The Yellow River and its springs had overflowed, destroying farmland and putting people in danger. So the emperor consulted his advisors to find a way to stop the flooding. They all agreed that a man by the name of Yu, who could transform into a dragon or a bear, was the only one who could succeed where others had failed.Yu's own father, Kun, had tried for ten years to build dams and dig ditches without success, the waters always overflowing any attempts to tame them. Upon the emperor's request, Yu came up with a plan. Yu knew that in Heaven there was a special ""swelling soil"" that multiplied when it touched water. He humbly asked the gods for the soil, and received it with their blessings. With the help of a winged dragon, Yu flew all over the land, using the soil to plug 250,000 springs, the sources of the water.That problem solved, Yu turned his attention to the Yellow River and the flood waters that still remained. Amazingly, the solution came not from the mind of Yu, but in the form of a map on the back of a tortoise shell. Using the map, and later the help of the gods, Yu and his dragon were able to dig irrigation ditches that finally diverted the water off the farmland and saved the day. As a reward for his diligence, upon the death of Shun, Yu the Great became the first emperor of the Xia dynasty.The Yellow River, said to be the ""Mother of the Chinese People,"" gets its color from the huge amounts of silt pulled from its banks and riverbed.

The Xia dynasty lasted approximately five hundred years, from the 21st to the 16th century BCE. It connected the Longshan people, who were the earliest culture of China known for their black-lacquered pottery, with the Shang dynasty that came much later.An Impenetrable LandThe Chinese are the longest continuous civilization in the world, spanning 7,000 years of history. How could Chinese civilization survive when so many other cultures have come and gone? One possible answer lies in the physical geography of the region.The Yellow Emperor, Huang Di, is supposed to have founded China in approximately 4000 BCE. There is no archaeological evidence to support that claim however, leaving Huang Di obscured through the veil of history and Chinese mythology as a part-real, part-legendary figure.

In fact, because they believed they were in the middle of the world, surrounded by natural barriers on all sides, the Chinese thought of themselves as ""Zhong Guo"" — the Middle Kingdom.Foreign invaders had great difficulty reaching China, and many of the most important discoveries, inventions, and beliefs of the West remained unknown to the Middle Kingdom. In the early years of their civilization, the Chinese developed a unique writing system, began using bronze for both tools and art, and created folk religions that later evolved into the philosophies of Taoism and Confucianism. These discoveries enabled the Chinese to develop a culture unlike any other the world has ever known.Shang Dynasty — China's First Recorded HistoryFuhao, the first woman to appear in Chinese written history, commanded an army of 10,000 soldiers during the Shang dynasty. ""Lu Yanguang"" courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Recorded history in China begins with the Shang dynasty. Scholars today argue about when the dynasty began, with opinions ranging from the mid-18th to the mid-16th century BCE. Regardless of the dates, one event more than any other signaled the advent of the Shang dynasty — the Bronze Age.It was during the Shang dynasty that bronze working became common. Thousands of artifacts from the ruins of Yin, the last capital of the Shang, were unearthed in the late 1920s and '30s. Bronze vessels for drinking were used in ritual ceremonies, while bronze chariots and axes were used in battle. As the metal was associated with royalty, the tombs of Shang kings contained hundreds of small bronze objects, even including hairpins.One of the few undisturbed tombs was that of the legendary Fuhao, wife of Wu-ting. Her tomb by itself contained 468 works of bronze and 775 pieces of jade. Some of the bronze objects found contained the first Chinese characters ever written. Very simple in nature, these characters often represented the name of the object's owner.Oracles written on tortoise shells serve as the earliest evidence of the development of a writing system in China. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Them BonesIn addition to bronze, examples of the early Chinese writing system can be found on oracle bones, another type of artifact characteristic to the Shang dynasty. Ancient Chinese priests commonly used tortoise shells and cattle bones to answer questions about the future. They interpreted the cracks formed by holes punched in the bones. Oracle bones also served as a way for the priests to write down the history of the dynasty and the timeline of kings.Today, more than 150,000 oracle bones have been recovered. Unfortunately, many more artifacts containing early Chinese writing have been lost. Writing made on books of bamboo strips and silk could not survive centuries of burial in the earth. Many of those that did survive were burned by the first emperor of the Ch'in dynasty in approximately 100 BCE.Shang SocietyFrom what has survived, archaeologists and historians have learned much of the Shang culture. The Shang were skilled workers in bone, jade, ceramics, stone, wood, shells, and bronze, as proven by the discovery of shops found on the outskirts of excavated palaces. The people of the Shang dynasty lived off of the land, and as time passed, settled permanently on farms instead of wandering as nomads.The Shang dynasty emerged in the 17th century BCE as the first true Chinese dynasty. Its boundaries are shown in gray. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.To guard against flooding by the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the ancient Shang developed complex forms of irrigation and flood control. The farming of millet, wheat, rice, and barley crops provided the major sources of food, but hunting was not uncommon. Domesticated animals raised by the Shang included pigs, dogs, sheep, oxen, and even silkworms.Like many other ancient cultures, the Shang created a social pyramid, with the king at the top, followed by the military nobility, priests, merchants, and farmers. Burials were one way in which the social classes were distinguished. The elite were buried in elaborate pit tombs with various objects of wealth for a possible use in the afterlife. Even an elephant was found among the ruins of an ancient tomb. The people who built these tombs were sometimes buried alive with the dead royalty. The lesser classes were buried in pits of varying size based on status, while people of the lowest classes were sometimes even tossed down wells.Beginning to BelieveAll of the classes however had one thing in common — religion. The major philosophies to later shape China — Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism — had not yet been formed. Folk religion during the Shang dynasty was polytheistic, meaning the people worshipped many gods.This bronze sculpture of a human head with gold leaf is typical of the bronze artwork created during the Shang dynasty. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Ancestor worship was also very important to the Shang. It was thought that the success of crops and the health and well being of people were based on the happiness of dead ancestors. If the ancestors of a family were pleased, life for that family would be prosperous. If the spirits were not pleased however, great tragedies could occur.In addition, the god worshipped by everyone during the Shang dynasty was Shang Ti, the ""lord on high."" Shang Ti was believed to be the link between people and heavenly beings. The souls of ancestors, it was thought, visited with Shang Ti and received their instructions from him. It was therefore very important to make sure that Shang Ti was happy. This was done with various rituals and prayers, offerings, and sometimes even human sacrifices.The last king of the Shang dynasty, Shang Chou, was a cruel man known for his methods of torture. The dynasty had been weakened by repeated battles with nomads and rivaling tribes within China. Shang Chou was ousted by the rebel leader Wu wang in 1111 BCE.Qin DynastyShi Huang-Ti was able to centralize power in China under the control of the emperor.  Unlike the Zhou dynasty and other early ruling dynastic families, where power was more feudalistic. The Zhou were more of a regional kingdom. The major tradition that was begun under Zhou was the idea/concept of the Mandate of Heaven. The Mandate of Heaven helped explain why rulers rise and fall.After the fall of the Shang dynasty in 1111 BCE, the succeeding dynasties of the Chou (1111-221 BCE) and the Ch'in (221-206 BCE) continued the great advances made by the early Chinese. Building techniques improved, and the use of iron became common. A system of hydraulics was used to dig riverbeds deeper, reducing the number of floods that destroyed farmland and endangered lives.However, during these dynasties there were also times of great disunity. Feudalism became popular during the Zhou dynasty, a practice in which the king shared his power with lords, who in turn paid the king for their lands and titles. As the Zhou dynasty weakened, lords fought among themselves. This Warring States period (403-221 BCE) only ended when all of northern China was united under the Ch'in regime.[Figure 12]The ancient Chinese healing systems of acupuncture and acupressure use diagrams of points, called meridians, to direct energy flow throughout the body. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Although the Ch'in created needed change in China's government, they were harsh leaders. They supported the idea of Legalism, which taught that human nature could not be trusted, and only with strict laws and severe penalties could society be successful. After only fifteen years, the Ch'in dynasty collapsed, replaced by Liu Pang of the Han. It was he who gained control over the border states, and established one of the most successful periods in Chinese history, the Han dynasty, in 202 BCE.The Rise of the HanThe Han dynasty immediately restored feudal lords to their positions of power. The Chinese people prospered in peace once again. Paper and porcelain were invented during the Han dynasty, as was the wheelbarrow. Legend states that paper was first created in 105 CE, but archaeological evidence suggests that it was in use up to 200 years earlier. In comparison, paper was not widely circulated in the West until 1150 CE, over one thousand years later.The 7,000-mile Silk Road flourished during the Han dynasty, allowing trade between China and India. ""The Electronic Passport to the Silk Road"" by Mike Dowling, courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The major achievements of the early Han dynasty revolve around the first emperor to reign under the Mandate of Heaven, Wu Ti. Emperors were under heaven's rule according to the mandate. Their success was based on the opinion of the gods. If the gods became unhappy with an emperor's rule, it was believed that signs would be sent to the Chinese people, usually in the form of natural disasters. In this event, the emperor lost theMandate of Heaven, and was usually overthrown.The gods must have looked upon Wu Ti favorably as he reigned for 54 years from 140-87 BCE, expanding the borders of China into Vietnam in the south and Korea in the north. However, it was his westward expansion that most influenced what became the Han Empire.The Great Wall of China runs 4,600 miles, and is said to be the only man-made structure visible from space. ""Beijing: Glimpses of History"" published by Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, China, courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Westward Ho!Wu Ti had heard rumors of powerful and wealthy lands to the west. In 138 BCE, the emperor sent the explorer Chang Ch'ien with a party of 100 men to search the western frontier. Thirteen years later, Chang Ch'ien returned with only one of the original 100 men and told amazing stories of capture and imprisonment in central Asia. Although he did not succeed in reaching the lands of Persia, Arabia, or the Roman Empire, Chang Ch'ien did learn plenty about them.Wu Ti sent Chang Ch'ien to central Asia again a few years later, this time to make alliances using gifts of cattle, gold, and silk. Wu Ti's chief historian, Ssu-ma Ch'ien, later kept a record of these journeys and much more in his work called theShiji(Records of the Historian). TheShijichronicles the history of China from the Xia dynasty up to the reign of Wu Ti.Chang Ch'ien's journeys began the widespread use of the trade route known as the Silk Road. Reaching as far west as the Caspian Sea, goods such as ivory, glass, wool, tapestries, exotic fruits and vegetables, precious metals and stones, even animals such as elephants and lions were imported into China. In return, foreign traders received furs, spices, jade, iron, ceramic, and bronze objects, as well as the much sought after silk. By the 1st century CE, silk clothing became the style and obsession of Roman citizens.Another Brick in the WallArguably the greatest achievement in all of Chinese history continued during the Han dynasty — the construction of the Great Wall of China. Originally begun during the Ch'in dynasty, Wu Ti restored the wall, and continued it another 300 miles into the Gobi Desert to protect against attacks from central Asia. The Gobi Desert section was made with stamped earth and reinforced with willow reeds.Chinese artisans learned the secret of creating porcelain during the Han period. Europeans figured out the same secret in 1709. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Yet the Great Wall has survived 2,000 years of invasion and erosion, spanning over 4,500 miles through northern China at the time of its completion. It is now regarded as one of the wonders of the world. The Great Wall came at a high price. At the height of its construction, one mile of wall was created each day, at an average cost of 10 lives per mile.Highs and LowsAcupuncture, the piercing of needles into the skin, became popular in the second century CE along with herbal medicine as a treatment for common illnesses. The Han also studied astronomical matters. They believed comets, eclipses, and other unusual celestial events were ominous signs that could be used to predict future disasters. They created atlases depicting the shapes of 29 different types of comets as well as the accurate positions of Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. Sunspots and exploding stars called nova were also first discovered during the Han dynasty.With only a short interruption by the reformer Wang Mang from 9-24 CE, the Han dynasty lasted for well over 400 years. But by the beginning of the third century C.E., the corruption in government that signaled the decline of nearly every Chinese dynasty had taken its toll. This corruption combined with political struggles and an increasing population, making a unified China impossible. The Han dynasty of China finally lost its Heavenly Mandate in 220 CE, beginning nearly 400 years of political chaos.Taoism and Confucianism — Ancient PhilosophiesAlthough he is an animal with a small brain, Winnie the Pooh understands better than most what it is to live effortlessly and happily, two characteristics of the Taoist way. Image courtesy of us history.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.""Those who know do not say; those who say do now know.""-Lao-tzu""The superior men are sparing in their words and profuse in their deeds.""-ConfuciusThe sixth century BCE was an amazing time of philosophical growth for ancient China. It was during that time that the two most influential spiritual leaders native to China, Confucius and Lao-tzu, are thought to have lived and taught. The philosophies that they practiced, Taoism and Confucianism, existed simultaneously in dynastic China, attracting countless numbers of followers over the past 2,500 years. The fascination of both the Eastern and Western worlds with these two legendary figures and the philosophies that they created remains strong.The Old MasterLao-tzu, translated as either ""Old Master"" or ""Old Boy,"" is believed to be the author of Taoism. Very little is known of his life; he may not even have existed. According to myth, at his birth around 604 BCE, Lao-tzu came from the womb as an old man, white-haired and full of wisdom. He eventually took a position as head librarian of the Imperial Archives. Saddened by society's lack of goodness, Lao-tzu decided to leave his home in Luoyang to live out the rest of his life in quiet and solitude somewhere beyond the Great Wall of China, possibly near Tibet. As he passed through the city gates for the final time, the gatekeeper asked Lao-tzu to write down his parting thoughts. The ""Old Master"" agreed, and three days later returned with a small book. Lao-tzu then left civilization, never to return. His writings were titled theTao Te Ching, and became the most important text of Taoism.Lao-tzu smiles while the Buddha and Confucius wince after they taste-test vinegar. The philosophies of ancient China are summarized in the faces of its three most colorful characters. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.According to Taoism, the entire universe and everything in it flows with a mysterious, unknowable force called the Tao. Translated literally as ""The Way,"" the Tao has many different meanings. It is the name that describes ultimate reality. The Tao also explains the powers that drive the universe and the wonder of human nature. Taoists believe that everything is one despite all appearances. Opinions of good and evil or true and false only happen when people forget that they are all one in the Tao. Therefore, it is the aim of Taoists not to forget, and if forgotten to remember that oneness. However, Lao-tzu reminds believers that the Tao is difficult to grasp: ""the Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao.""Over time a Taoist religion evolved, becoming somewhat different from the philosophy of Taoism just described. While religious Taoism held some of the same beliefs, it also called for worship of many gods and ancestors, a practice that began during the Shang dynasty. Other religious practices included the cultivation of bodily energy called ""chi,"" the creation of a system of morals, and use of alchemy in attempts to attain immortality. The folk religion of Taoism became popular after its adoption by China as the state religion in 440 CE, and continues to be practiced even to the present day.Confucius and the AnnalectsThe other driving philosophy of dynastic China was created by a politician, musician, and philosopher named Confucius. Born in 551 BCE, Confucius wandered throughout China, first as a government employee, and later as a political advisor to the rulers of the Chou dynasty. In later life, Confucius left politics to teach a small group of students. After his death in 479 BCE, the ethics and moral teachings of Confucius were written down by his students to become theLun-yü, orAnalects. Many of his clever sayings are still followed today. ""It is as hard to be poor without complaining as to be rich without becoming arrogant.""Lao-tzu, known as the ""Old Master,"" wrote his parting thoughts on the Tao or The Way before he left civilization. The Tao Te Ching, as this writing came to be known, has influenced millions during the last 2,500 years. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Learning to be human was the goal of Confucianism. According to Confucius, each person should act with virtue in all social matters: family, community, state, and kingdom, to ensure order and unity. Man's virtue in all its forms is called ""jen"" -- all encompassing and unable to be defined -- which in some respects is similar to the Tao. Confucian ceremonies contained many rituals based in the Five Classics, especially theI Ching, orBook of Changes. Procedures for birth, marriage, and death were rigid and specific. For example, according to Confucian funeral tradition, a willow branch is always carried behind the body of the deceased symbolizing the soul of that person.However, by far the most influential aspect of Confucianism remains theAnalects: ""Not to teach a man who can be taught, is to waste a man; to teach a man who cannot be taught, is a waste of words. The wise will lose neither men nor words."" It was sayings such as this one that made Confucianism the social philosophy of China from the Han dynasty in 202 BCE until the end of dynastic rule in 1911.Rival PhilosophiesTaoism and Confucianism have lived together in China for well over 2,000 years. Confucianism deals with social matters, while Taoism concerns itself with the search for meaning. They share common beliefs about man, society, and the universe, although these notions were around long before either philosophy. Both began as philosophies, each later taking on religious overtones. Legend states that Confucius and Lao-tzu did in fact meet to discuss the Imperial Archives. Lao-tzu was unimpressed by the beautiful robes worn by Confucius, and did not agree with looking back on the past. ""Put away your polite airs and your vain display of fine robes. The wise man does not display his treasures to those he does not know. And he cannot learn justice from the Ancients.""Regardless of the disagreements between Lao-tzu and Confucius, both Taoism and Confucianism have served as guides. They have led China through the peaks and valleys of its vast history, the longest continuing story on the planet.Video AssignmentInteractive Notebook AssignmentsReview QuestionsHow did the dynastic cycle and the belief in the Mandate of Heaven provide legitimacy to the reigning dynasty in China?How did the Mandate of Heaven aid in the overthrow of an ineffective or abusive dynasty?After the civil wars in China, how did the philosophies of Confucianism and Daoism help restore order and answer essential questions of human existence?Explain how Shih Huang-Ti established himself as an absolute ruler of China.How did the Han emperors strengthen their own power and weaken the power and independence of the nobles?How did Confucianism influence the social stratification of Chinese civilization?Explain how the subordination of females to males extended throughout a woman's life.Describe the factors that led to the eventual collapse of Han China.VocabularyConfucianismA Chinese social philosophy that stressed social harmony organized around five basic relationships, each with an established code of conduct.DaoismA philosophy originated by Lao Tzu that focuses upon a universal force that guides all things.

[WH.26C]The Rise of PersiaCreation of the Achaemenid Persian Empire[Figure 2]The probable extent of the Median Empire.Image credit:History of Persia, licensed CC BY-SA 4.0In 559 BCE, a man namedCyrusbecame the leader of Persia. He was the great-great-grandson of the first Persian king, Achaemenes—whose name is why historians call this theAchaemenidPersian Empire! Prior to Cyrus’s rule, Persia was a small tributary state to the Median Empire, which happened to be ruled by Cyrus’s grandfather, Astyages. Persia paid the Medes for protection and to maintain a level of independence.Cyrus came into conflict with his grandfather—for reasons that are unknown—and initiated a rebellion that ultimately succeeded in 550 BCE. Cyrus commemorated his victory over Astyages by building a city on the site of the battle and naming it Pasargadae, after his tribe.By defeating Astyages, Cyrus took on his role as ruler of what had been the Median Empire. Not everyone who had been paying tribute to Astyages accepted Cyrus as their new ruler, however. In order to solidify his power, Cyrus had to find ways to bring lesser rulers under his control. His success earned Cyrus the title of Cyrus the Great.Religious Toleration and Maintaining Local TraditionsCyrus was a successful military commander, but he also recognized the need to leave the regions that he conquered in good economic order if they were going to provide him with tribute revenues. To achieve this, Cyrus left local rulers in place after conquering a region, and he allowed the local population to continue practicing their preferred religious traditions. These policies ensured that conquered regions continued to function economically and reduced the chance that they would rebel against him.In ancient Mesopotamia, a common imperial strategy was to relocate conquered populations to new areas in order to break up their political and cultural unity and make them less dangerous to the ruling power. Cyrus reversed this practice by allowing the Jews, who had been relocated by the Babylonians, to return to Israel and establish a tributary state. While this might appear to be an act of generosity, it was probably a calculated move on the part of Cyrus to help ensure Jewish loyalty, and thus a continuation of his general policy of tolerance.Political DevelopmentsCyrus’s son, Cambyses II, added to the Achaemenid Empire by conquering Egypt. While Cambyses II was away in Egypt, a man pretending to be his brother tried to take control of the empire. Cambyses died in 522 BCE while returning from Egypt to remove this pretender and was succeeded by a general namedDarius. Although Darius had a legitimate claim in that he was distantly related to Cambyses II, several other claimants to the Persian throne challenged Darius. Many regions saw the resulting chaos as an opportunity to rebel against Achaemenid rule.Darius eventually established himself as the sole ruler of Persia and reconquered the rebellious regions, growing the Achaemenid Empire to its greatest extent. Partly as a response to the initial challenges that he faced, Darius reorganized the empire by dividing it intosatrapies, or provinces. For each satrapy, Darius appointed a satrap—a political governor—and a military commander. The division of military and political power was meant to prevent regional leaders from becoming too powerful. Unlike the system of local control employed by Cyrus, Darius appointed these satraps directly, meaning that their loyalty was to him.Like most ancient rulers, Darius used religion to justify his power. He claimed that the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, had appointed him to rule the world. To emphasize his power over his appointed satraps—and also to demonstrate that he was ruler of a diverse empire, rather than of a single kingdom or people—he took the title ofShahanshah, King of Kings. The idea here was to avoid the appearance of favoring a particular group or region within the empire.Economic reformsDarius introduced a standard currency—a gold coin known as a daric. Having standardized currency encouraged more economic activity within the empire by making transactions easier. Unlike specific goods and services, money was accepted by almost everyone in exchange for almost anything and was also easier to transport than most goods. Standardized currency also allowed Darius to collect taxes and tributes in coin rather than in goods or services, which allowed him to concentrate the empire’s wealth where he chose.The ability to concentrate wealth combined with the expansion of the territory under Achaemenid control allowed Darius to pay for the construction of an impressive new imperial capital, called Parsa, better known to history as Persepolis, which in Greek meanscity of the Persians. The city incorporated artistic and architectural styles from throughout the empire and, because it was built in a mountainous region with elaborate defenses, was home to Darius’s imperial vault.The construction of Persepolis represented the growing power of the Achaemenids not only in terms of its art and grandeur, but also because of its location. Darius chose the site of Persepolis specifically because it was difficult to access. The Achaemenids already had several capital cities, all of which were better placed in terms of accessibility and economic potential. Persepolis was only possible because of the wealth and power Darius had gained and he may have built it to emphasize precisely this point.[Figure 3]The Behistun Inscription was carved along a road between the cities of Ecbatana and Babylon, the capitals of Media and Babylonia, respectively, during the reign of Darius I. The inscription recorded the history of the Persian kings in three languages: Elamite, Babylonian, and Old Persian.Image credit:Hara1603, public domainBesides building an entirely new city, Darius also worked to improve many existing cities with repairs and new construction. One particularly ambitious project was digging a canal between the Nile River and the Red Sea to make trade easier. All of these improvements were made possible by the increased wealth that came with imperial expansion.TheRoyal Road—a highway running from the city of Sardis in the west to Susa in the east, see map—was completed during Darius’s reign. Darius created a spy network to ensure that satraps were carrying out his orders and to watch for signs of rebellion. A system of messengers and horses along the Royal Road allowed for the speedy transmission of information to and from Darius. In an age when overland transport was expensive and dangerous, the road also offered traders a relatively safe and efficient route.[Figure 4]The Royal Road.Image credit:Fabienkhan,CC BY-SA 2.5-2.0-1.0Decline of Achaemenid PowerIn 499 BCE, the Greek city-states in Ionia—the western region of modern-day Turkey, represented by the red dots on the coast near Sardes on the above map—rebelled against Achaemenid rule. They were supported in their rebellion by city-states in Greece, which led to retaliatory Persian invasions of Greece. In 490 BCE, Darius’s army was famously defeated by the Greeks at the Battle of Marathon. Between 480 and 479 BCE, Darius’s son,Xerxes, was more successful, but he ultimately failed to subdue the Greeks as well.Xerxes’s failure to defeat the Greeks marked the end of Achaemenid expansion. Over the following century and a half, the Achaemenid kings increased taxes and continued to interfere in Greece via economic and political strategies, rather than military invasions. With the end of expansion came more attempts by regional rulers to escape from Achaemenid control; many of the distinct groups within the empire saw less and less reason to remain a part of it.In 334 BCE, Alexander of Macedon invaded the Persian Empire, and by 330 BCE, the Persian king, Darius III, was dead—murdered by one his generals. Alexander claimed the Persian throne. Alexander left the officials and institutions of the cities he captured in place to manage his massive empire. After his death, one of his generals,Seleucus, gained control of much of the territory that had been the Achaemenid Empire.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Persian Art, An IntroductionEssay by Dr. Senta GermanA Tolerant EmpireAlthough the surviving literary sources on the Persian empire were written by ancient Greeks who were the sworn enemies of the Persians and highly contemptuous of them, the Persians were in fact quite tolerant and ruled a multi-ethnic empire. Persia was the first empire known to have acknowledged the different faiths, languages, and political organizations of its subjects.[Figure 5]The Persian Empire, 490 B.C.E.This tolerance for the cultures under Persian control carried over into administration. In the landsthatthey conquered, the Persians continued to use indigenous languages and administrative structures. For example, the Persians accepted hieroglyphic script written on papyrus in Egypt and traditional Babylonian record keeping in cuneiform in Mesopotamia. The Persians must have been very proud of this new approach to empire as can be seen in the representation of the many different peoples in the reliefs from Persepolis, a city founded by Darius the Great in the sixth century BCE.[Figure 6]Gate of All Nations, PersepolisThe ApadanaPersepolis included a massive columned hall used for receptions by the Kings, called the Apadana. This hall contained 72 columns and two monumental stairways.[Figure 7]Assyrians with Rams, Apadana, PersepolisThe walls of the spaces and stairs leading up to the reception hall were carved with hundreds of figures, several of which illustrated subject peoples of various ethnicities, bringing tribute to the Persian king.[Figure 8]Apadana staircase, Persepolis, IranConquered by Alexander the GreatThe Persian Empire was, famously, conquered by Alexander the Great. Alexander no doubt was impressed by the Persian system of absorbing and retaining local language and traditions as he imitated this system himself in the vast lands he won in battle. Indeed, Alexander made a point of burying the last Persian emperor, Darius III, in a lavish and respectful way in the royal tombs near Persepolis. This enabled Alexander to claim title to the Persian throne and legitimize his control over the greatest empire of the Ancient Near East.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Video AssignmentDiscussion QuestionsWhere andhow did Zoroastrianism originate?What are the major beliefs of Zoroastrianism?What similarities are there between the teaching of Zoroaster and the religious concepts found later in Christianity?Interactive Notebook ActivitiesConduct a SPICES analysis of the Persian Empire.Complete a SPICES chart and identify at least three characteristics for each category in the SPICES acronym.Create a time capsule of the Persian Empire.The time capsule should include at least 10 artifacts that represent the political, cultural, and social characteristics of the Persian Empire.Write a one page explanation of the importance of the artifacts for someone opening the time capsule.Create a graphic organizer identifying the major developments of the Persian Empire.ReviewQuestionsIn what ways did river valley civilizations influence the development of the Persian Empire?What strategies were used by Cyrus and Darius to rule over their empires?How did a standard currency allow Darius greater control over his empire’s resources?What was the purpose of the the Royal Road in the Persian Empire?What impact did religion have on Persian society?VocabularyCyruswas the founder of the Achaemenid Empire.

Philosophy. Sculpture. Dramatic tragedies. The Olympic Games.Many of the fundamental elements of Western culture first arose more than 2000 years ago in ancient Greece.After conquering the Greeks, the ancient Romans spread Greek ideas throughout their empire, which included much of Europe.After the fall of the Roman Empire, these ideas lost their prominence in European society during most of the Middle Ages (500-1500 CE). It was not until the Renaissance (1350-1500 CE) that the ancient Greek and Roman origins of many European institutions and practices were rediscovered.One prominent element of Greek thought was the concept that humans are the measure of all things. The ancient Greeks wanted to know how the universe works. To probe such questions, the Greeks turned to philosophy, mathematics, and science.All Things HumanThis gold burial mask is known famously as the Mask of Agamemnon, the heroic king of Mycenae in Homer's Iliad. Though mystery still surrounds the 16th century B.C.E. Minoan and Mycenaean cultures, archaeologists have found fascinating artifacts, including frescoes, palaces, tombs, and other burial masks. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.The glorification of the human form and of human accomplishment defined ancient Greek art, philosophy, literature, and religion. Even their gods were created in the image of humans. The Greek gods had human emotions, looked like humans, and behaved more like people than infallible gods.The Greeks' emphasis on the individual is one major cornerstone of Western Civilization. Indeed, the spirit of individualism as defined by the Greeks is still alive and well in modern American culture and society.The Greeks were the first in the West to experiment with the concept of democratic government. Many successful modern democratic governments in the world today are heirs to the Greek model. It must be pointed out that though the Greeks developed the notion of ""government by the people,"" most people were still excluded from the political process.The First GreeksTwo major groups of people, the Minoans and the Mycenaeans, were the first to populate the Greek peninsula. Not much is known about either of these groups because they did not leave an abundance of written or physical evidence to provide clues about their civilization. However, it is known that by 1650 BCE, the Minoans occupied the island of Crete that is south of the Greek mainland. The Minoans were named for the legendary ruler of Crete, King Minos. Historians believe that the Minoans were seafaring traders who developed a rich, diverse culture.The Mycenaeans came from a group of people who migrated from India through the Middle East and into Greece around the year 2000 BCE. These Indo-Europeans mixed with the native population of Greece to become the Mycenaeans. Over time, both the Minoans and Mycenaeans expanded and conquered territory until the two civilizations ran into one another.Historians suspect that in the ensuing conflict the Mycenaeans wiped out the Minoans, whose civilization and culture disappeared somewhat mysteriously. By 1200 BCE, the Mycenaeans were in turn wiped out by another group known as the Dorians. This ushered in a Dark Age that lasted from 1150 to 800 BCE. During this time, economic activity ground to a halt, and literacy disappeared. Not much is known about this period in Greek history.But a highly developed civilization resurfaced. From politics and philosophy to art, medicine, and science, the ancient Greeks generated thoughts that shaped the record of humankind for the next 2,500 years.Rise of City-States: Athens and SpartaThe Acropolis played an integral role in Athenian life. This hilltop not only housed the famous Parthenon, but it also included temples, theaters, and other public buildings that enhanced Athenian culture. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Geography plays a critical role in shaping civilizations, and this is particularly true of ancient Greece.The Greek peninsula has two distinctive geographic features that influenced the development of Greek society. First, Greece has easy access to water. The land contains countless scattered islands, deep harbors, and a network of small rivers. This easy access to water meant that the Greek people might naturally become explorers and traders.Second, Greece's mountainous terrain led to the development of the polis (city-state), beginning about 750 BCE. The high mountains made it very difficult for people to travel or communicate. Therefore, each polis developed independently and, often, very differently from one another. Eventually, the polis became the structure by which people organized themselves. Athens and Sparta are two good examples of city-states that contrasted greatly with each other.Athens: The Think TankThe city-state of Athens was the birthplace of many significant ideas. Ancient Athenians were a thoughtful people who enjoyed the systematic study of subjects such as science, philosophy, and history, to name a few.Athenians placed a heavy emphasis on the arts, architecture, and literature. The Athenians built thousands of temples and statues that embodied their understanding of beauty. Today the term ""classical"" is used to describe their enduring style of art and architecture.Athenians also enjoyed a democratic form of government in which some of the people shared power.Life was not easy for Athenian women. They did not enjoy the same rights or privileges as males, being nearly as low as slaves in the social system. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Did you know?Women in MythologyConsidering their limited role in actual society there is a surprisingly strong cast of female characters inGreek religionand mythology.Athena, the goddess of wisdom and patron of Athens stands out as a powerful figure blessed with intelligence, courage and honour. Again common to most ancient cultures where agriculture was crucial to the community, female fertility goddesses were extremely important and particularly venerated -DemeterandPersephonebeing the most revered for the Greeks.As in other ancient male-dominatedliterature, women are often cast as troublemakers, from jealousHeratoAphroditeemploying her charms to make men lose their wits. Myths and literature abound with female characters trying their best to derail the plans of male heroes, from the supreme witch Medea to the deadly, if lovely, Sirens. They can also be represented as ruled only by wild passion and ecstatic emotion such as the Maenads. In contrast, the ideal chaste woman loyal to her absent husband is epitomised by Penelope inHomer’sOdyssey. TheMusesare another positive representation, celebrated not only for their physical beauty but also their wide-ranging skills in the arts. Whether these fictional characters had any bearing on the role of women in real life is an open question, as is the more intriguing one of what did Greek women themselves think of such male-created role-models? Perhaps we will never know.For more information, visit ""Women in Ancient Greece"" by Mark Cartwright, Ancient History Encyclopedia.Sparta: Military MightLife in Sparta was vastly different from life in Athens. Located in the southern part of Greece on the Peloponnisos peninsula, the city-state of Sparta developed a militaristic society ruled by two kings and an oligarchy, or small group that exercised political control.Ares, the Greek god of war, was a particularly fitting patron for Sparta, which was known to be a rather warlike society. When they weren't fighting another city-state, Spartans were honing their military skills in preparation for the next battle. ""Ares Borghese"" by Maicar Förlag, courtesy of us history.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Early in their history, a violent and bloody slave revolt caused the Spartans to change their society. A Spartan, Lycurgus, drafted a harsh set of laws that required total dedication to the state from its people. The laws' goal was to train citizens to become hardened soldiers so that they could fight off potential enemies or slave revolts. The result was a rigid lifestyle unlike any seen in Greece at the time. The devotion of Spartans to developing a military state left little time for the arts or literature.A Spartan baby had to be hardy and healthy. To test a baby's strength, parents would leave their child on a mountain overnight to see if it could survive on its own until the next morning. By age seven, Spartan boys were taken from their families and underwent severe military training. They wore uniforms at all times, ate small meals of bland foods, exercised barefoot to toughen their feet, and were punished severely for disobedient behavior. Boys lived away from their families in barracks until the age of 30, even after they were married. Men were expected to be ready to serve in the army until they were 60 years old.Women, too, were expected to be loyal and dedicated to the state. Like men, women followed a strict exercise program and contributed actively to Spartan society. Although they were not allowed to vote, Spartan women typically had more rights and independence than women in other Greek city-states.Winning by LosingThe differences between Athens and Sparta eventually led to war between the two city-states. Known as the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE), both Sparta and Athens gathered allies and fought on and off for decades because no single city-state was strong enough to conquer the others.Did you know?The whole of Hellas used once to carry arms, their habitations being unprotected, and their communication with each other unsafe; indeed, to wear arms was as much a part of everyday life with them as with the barbarians. [2] And the fact that the people in these parts of Hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life was once equally common to all. [3] The Athenians were the first to lay aside their weapons, and to adopt an easier and more luxurious mode of life; indeed, it is only lately that their rich old men left off the luxury of wearing undergarments of linen, and fastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers, a fashion which spread to their Ionian kindred, and long prevailed among the old men there. Thuycidides,The Peloponnesian War,(1910 translation by Richard Crawley)With war came famine, plague, death, and misfortune. But war cannot kill ideas. Despite the eventual military surrender of Athens, Athenian thought spread throughout the region. After temporary setbacks, these notions only became more widely accepted and developed with the passing centuries.Democracy Is BornPericles was such a great, influential ruler of Athens that the period of history during his reign has been dubbed the Age of Pericles. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The men wearing red paint were in big trouble.In fact, they would probably have to pay a fine for not appearing at the assembly meeting. After being caught shirking their duty as citizens of Athens, they had been marked with red paint as punishment.In Athenian democracy, every citizen was required to participate or suffer punishment. This practice stands in stark contrast to modern democratic governments in which citizens can choose whether or not they wish to participate. In Athenian democracy, all citizens pulled their weight.Not everyone in Athens was considered a citizen. Only free, adult men enjoyed the rights and responsibility of citizenship. Only about 20 percent of the population of Athens were citizens. Women were not citizens and therefore could not vote or have any say in the political process. They were rarely permitted out in public and were even restricted as to where they could be within their own homes. Slaves and foreigners were not citizens and also could not participate in the democracy. In the end, democracy existed only for the free men who were originally from Athens.A Worthy ContributionCroesus shows his treasures to Solon in this 17th-century painting. Solon has been called one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Nevertheless, the idea of democratic government is one of the most significant contributions of the ancient Greeks. The city-state of Athens had one of the largest democracies in terms of population.Early in Athens' history (around 594 BCE), a man named Solon (wise and skillful lawgiver) enacted reforms that helped reduce the growing gap between the rich and the poor. Poor citizens gained the right to sit in the assembly to vote.Later, Cleisthenes expanded the democracy by giving every citizen equal rights. He also created a legislative body whose members were picked randomly from the general population of citizens.Under the tyrant Draco, justice in ancient Athens was pretty harsh. Although he was the first person to write down the laws of Athens, according to Plutarch, Draco, ""wrote his laws in blood, not ink."" Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Typically, the citizens of Athens would gather in the agora when there was an assembly meeting. The agora, a fixture of every major Greek city-state, was a large open space in the middle of the city-state that contained a marketplace as well as government buildings. There, citizens would mingle and discuss the issues of the day before gathering for the assembly meeting.During the meeting, citizens were free to express their opinions and cast their votes. It was in these meeting that people could be marked with red paint if they were not fulfilling their civic duty.The courts, too, were usually in the agora. The juries in court cases were very large, often numbering in the hundreds and sometimes in the thousands. To be fair, Athenians wanted their juries to reflect the general population. There were no lawyers. Each citizen was expected to make his own case.Athenian democracy depended on every citizen fulfilling his role. All citizens were expected to vote, but they were also expected to serve in the government if necessary. In Athens, the people governed, and the majority ruled. All citizens had equal rights and powers.In a city-state as small as Athens, a pure democracy was possible. As states grew larger, the notion of electing representatives to make decisions for the public become more practical. But the idea that every citizen has a voice important enough to be heard originated in ancient Athens.Gods, Goddesses, and HeroesA family portrait of the 12 Olympians. But wait, who's that crouching by Zeus? Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The ancients Greeks were polytheistic — that is, they worshipped many gods. Their major gods and goddesses lived at the top of Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece, and myths described their lives and actions. In myths, gods often actively intervened in the day-to-day lives of humans. Myths were used to help explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson.For example, Zeus, the king of the gods, carried his favorite weapon, the thunderbolt. When it rained and there was thunder and lightning, the ancient Greeks believed that Zeus was venting his anger.Many stories about how the Greek gods behaved and interacted with humans are found in the works of Homer. He created two epic poems: theIliad, which related the events of the Trojan War, and theOdyssey, which detailed the travels of the hero Odysseus. These two poems were passed down orally over many generations.The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (recreated above) was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Zeus was the ruler of the gods, the lord of the skies, and the father of countless deities and demigods of the Greek pantheon. Image of this painting by M. Larrinaga, courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.[Figure 12]Aphrodite, the goddess of love, sits with the war god, Ares in this painting by the Renaissance artist Botticelli. Aphrodite is one of several Greek goddesses, and is often referred to by her Roman name, Venus.A Soap Opera from HellasMany Greek myths explained the mysteries of nature. The myth of Apollo, for example, describes how the sun moves across the sky to rise and set each day. Courtesy of NASA and Cislunar Aerospace, Inc., licensed under CC BY 4.0.The Greeks created gods in the image of humans; that is, their gods had many human qualities even though they were gods. The gods constantly fought among themselves, behaved irrationally and unfairly, and were often jealous of each other. Zeus, the king of the gods, was rarely faithful to his wife Hera. In response, Hera often plotted against Zeus and punished his mistresses.The Greek gods were highly emotional and behaved inconsistently and sometimes immorally. Greek religion did not have a standard set of morals, there were no Judaic Ten Commandments. The gods, heroes, and humans of Greek mythology were flawed.In addition to Zeus and Hera, there were many other major and minor gods in the Greek religion. At her birth, Athena, the goddess of wisdom, sprang directly from the head of Zeus. Hermes, who had winged feet, was the messenger of the gods and could fly anywhere with great speed. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, was the most beautiful being in the universe. Her brother, Ares, the god of war, was sinister, mean, and disliked. Poseidon, ruled the sea from his underwater place and Apollo rode his chariot across the sky, bringing the sun with him.Hades was in charge of the dead in the underworld. Almost all people went to Hades after they died whether they were good or bad. To get there, the dead had to cross the river Styx. Charon was the name of the boatman who ferried the souls of the dead across the river Styx to Hades.Typically, the gods punished those who were bad. For example, Tantalus who killed his own son and served him to the gods for dinner was sent to Hades and made forever thirsty and hungry. Although there was a pool of clear, fresh drinking water at his feet, whenever Tantalus bent down to drink, the pool would dry up and disappear.Likewise, over his head hung the most delicious fruit. However, whenever Tantalus reached for them, a wind would blow them just out of his reach. The English word ""tantalize"" derives from the name Tantalus.Pandora's Box and Hercules' LaborsMyths helped explain how the world came to be the way it was. In one myth, Zeus created an incredibly beautiful and nearly perfect woman named Pandora. Her one flaw was that she was very curious and suspicious. Hermes, Zeus's messenger, gave Pandora a golden box. He warned her never to open it because terrible things would occur if she did.But Pandora could hardly contain her curiosity and eventually broke down and opened the special box. Out from the box flew all the evils that plague humanity: famine, greed, pain, sorrow, etc. Only one thing remained in the box — hope — which humans managed to hold on to. This myth explains the origins of human misfortune. At the same time, it teaches a moral lesson by warning of the dangers of curiosity.In addition to myths about gods, the ancient Greeks also told stories about heroes. One of the most famous Greek heroes was Hercules, the world's strongest man. Hercules was the illegitimate son of a mortal woman and Zeus, who tricked the woman by disguising himself as the woman's husband. Hera, Zeus's wife, was angry about Zeus' affair and sought to punish Hercules. Hera tricked Hercules into believing that his entire family were dangerous beasts, which Hercules then proceeded to kill. When Hercules realized that he had killed his entire family, he agreed to perform 12 tasks to atone for his terrible actions. For one of the tasks, Hercules had to slay the nine-headed monster called the Hydra.For another task, he had to clean the filth from Augean stable, which had not been attended to in 30 years. To do this, Hercules diverted the course of a river that washed away the mess. In the end, he completed the so-called 12 Labors of Hercules and made up for the murder of his family.God/GoddessImportant AttributesZeusKing of the gods, Zeus killed his father Chronos.

This not only provided excellent seating arrangements, but remarkable acoustics as well. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.Thousands would come from far and wide to see the opening of the latest drama by Aeschylus, the most famous of Athenian playwrights. The citizens of Athens felt it was a part of their civic duty to attend as many dramas as possible.The dramas typically dealt with important issues of the day, posed tough questions, and educated theatergoers. Attendance at dramas was considered such a valuable experience that sometimes the government would pay for the tickets.. . . and PoetryAmong the earliest Greek literature was Homer's epic poems, theIliadand theOdyssey. TheIliadis a detailed telling of the Trojan War while theOdysseyrecounts Odysseus' 20-year journey home following the Trojan War.Created as early as 900 BCE, Homer's poems were not written down since Greek civilization lacked a written language at that time. Instead, these massive poems were passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth.An Excerpt from theIliadThe passage that follows is from Book XXII of theIliad. It describes a scene from the Trojan War that occurs just before Achilles, the Greek warrior, slays the Trojan hero, Hector.Old King Priam was the first to see Achilles rushing towards the Trojans over the fields. As Achilles ran, the bronze on his breast flashed out like the star that comes to us in autumn, outshining all its fellows in the evening sky — they call it Orion's Dog, and though it is the brightest of all the stars it bodes no good, bringing much fever, as it does, to us poor wretches. The old man gave a groan. He lifted up his hands and beat his head with them. In a voice full of terror he shouted entreaties to his beloved son, who had taken his stand in front of the gates in the fixed resolve to fight it out with Achilles.""Hector!"" the old man called, stretching out his arms to him in piteous appeal. ""I beg you, my dear son, not to stand up to that man alone and unsupported. You are courting defeat and death at his hands. He is far stronger than you, and he is savage. The dogs and vultures would soon be feeding on his corpse (and what a load would be lifted from my heart!) if the gods loved him as little as I do — the man who has robbed me of so many splendid sons, killed them or sold them off as slaves to the distant isles. So come inside the walls, my child, to be the savior of Troy and the Trojans; and do not throw away your dear life to give a triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity too on me, your poor father, who is still able to feel.As he came to an end, Priam plucked at his gray locks and tore the hair from his head; but he failed to shake Hector's resolution. And now his mother in her turn began to wail and weep. ""Hector, my child,"" she cried, ""deal with your enemy from within the walls and do not go out to meet that man in single combat. He is a savage; and you need not think that, if he kills you, I shall lay you on a bier and weep for you, my own, my darling boy; nor will your richly dowered wife; but far away from both of us, beside the Argive ships, you will be eaten by the nimble dogs.""–Translated by Reverend William T.

Some scholars credit Hesiod with being one of the first to actually write down his work.Around the same time of Hesiod, there was another growing group of writers known as the Lyric poets. One of the most famous of the Lyric poets was Sappho, who wrote about the world around her and focused particularly on the themes of love and sexuality. Sappho, who was bisexual, frequently wrote about her homosexual love affairs. The ancient Greeks were completely tolerant of homosexuality and did not discriminate. The word ""lesbian"" comes from the name of Sappho's island of birth, Lesbos.""To Aphrodite"" by SapphoYou know the place: thenLeave Crete and come to us waiting where the grove ispleasantest, by precinctssacred to you; incense smokes on the altar, cold streams murmur through the applebranches, a young rose thicket shades the groundand quivering leaves pourdown deep sleep; in meadows where horses have grown sleekamong spring flowers, dillscents the air. Queen! Cyprian! Fill our gold cups with love stirred into clear nectar.– Translated by Reverend William T. McNiff,The Pageant of Literature: Greek and Roman WritersThe Age of PericlesThe years between 461 to 429 BCE marked the Age of Pericles. Named after an Athenian leader, arts and literature flourished in this era. Outdoor theaters were built in Athens and other city-states for performances of the latest dramas. Made of stone, the theaters were positioned so that scenes of natural beauty served as backdrops for the stage.For example, the Greek theater at Taormina in Sicily is built high upon a rocky hill. Behind the audience's back lay the blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Perfectly centered behind the stage and facing the audience, sits the active, smoldering volcano, Mount Etna.The Greeks held drama festivals in which plays competed against one another for the audience's favor. During these festivals, the Greeks performed the plays as a tribute to the gods. The first major drama festival of the spring in Athens honored Dionysus, the god of grapes and wine. This festival celebrated the renewal of the grape vines.On stage, actors could play several roles by wearing different masks A chorus of several people in the background chanted from time to time, serving as a kind of narrator, and helping move the plot along.Tragic LiteratureAll three of the most famous ancient Greek writers specialized in tragedies. Tragedy is a form of drama in which a strong central character or hero ultimately fails and is punished by the gods. Usually, the hero has a fatal flaw that causes his undoing.For many years, Aeschylus (525-456 BCE) was the most successful dramatist in Athens winning several competitions. One of his rivals, the Athenian writer Sophocles (496-406 BCE), wrote the famous playOedipus Rex, (Oedipus the King). In this play, the main character, Oedipus is fated by the gods to kill his father and marry his own mother. Despite Oedipus's efforts to avoid this outcome, it happens just as the gods predicted. In shame, Oedipus blinds himself and is then banished.A third major writer named Euripides (484-406 BCE) focused more on people than gods in his writing. Among Euripides most famous works areElectraandThe Trojan Women.An Excerpt from ""Medea"" by EuripidesIn this tragic story, Medea has been deserted by her husband, Jason, who has left to marry the daughter of King Creon. In revenge, Medea ultimately kills the two children she and Jason share, and then herself.The chorus enters. The following lines between the Nurse, Chorus, and Medea are sung.ChorusI heard the voice, uplifted loud, of our poor Colchian lady, nor yet is she quiet; speak, aged dame, for as I stood by the house with double gates I heard a voice of weeping from within, and I do grieve, lady, for the sorrows of this house, for it hath won my love.Nurse'Tis a house no more; all that is passed away long since; a royal bride keeps Jason at her side, while our mistress pines away in her bower, finding no comfort for her soul in aught her friends can say.Medea (from within)Oh, oh! Would that Heaven's levin bolt would cleave this head in twain! What gain is life to me?Woe, woe is me! O, to die and win release, quitting this loathed existence!ChorusDidst hear, O Zeus, thou earth, and thou, O light, the piteous note of woe the hapless wife is uttering? How shall a yearning for that insatiate resting-place ever hasten for thee, poor reckless one, the end that death alone can bring? Never pray for that. And if thy lord prefers a fresh love, be not angered with him for that; Zeus will judge 'twixt thee and him herein. Then mourn not for thy husband's loss too much, nor waste thyself away.Medea (from within)Great Themis, and husband of Themis, behold what I am suffering now, though I did bind that accursed one, my husband, by strong oaths to me! O, to see him and his bride some day brought to utter destruction, they and their house with them, for that they presume to wrong me thus unprovoked. O my father, my country, that I have left to my shame, after slaying my own brother.NurseDo ye hear her words, how loudly she adjures Themis, oft invoked, and Zeus, whom men regard as keeper of their oaths? On no mere trifle surely will our mistress spend her rage.ChorusWould that she would come forth for us to see, and listen to the words of counsel we might give, if haply she might lay aside the fierce fury of her wrath, and her temper stern. Never be my zeal at any rate denied my friends! But go thou and bring her hither outside the house, and tell her this our friendly thought; haste thee ere she do some mischief to those inside the house, for this sorrow of hers is mounting high.NurseThis will I do; but I doubt whether I shall persuade my mistress; still willingly will I undertake this trouble for you; albeit, she glares upon her servants with the look of a lioness with cubs, whenso anyone draws nigh to speak to her. Wert thou to call the men of old time rude uncultured boors thou wouldst not err, seeing that they devised their hymns for festive occasions, for banquets, and to grace the board, a pleasure to catch the ear, shed o'er our life, but no man hath found a way to allay hated grief by music and the minstrel's varied strain, whence arise slaughters and fell strokesof fate to o'erthrow the homes of men. And yet this were surely a gain, to heal men's wounds by music's spell, but why tune they their idle song where rich banquets are spread? For of itself doth the rich banquet, set before them, afford to men delight.ChorusI heard a bitter cry of lamentation! loudly, bitterly she calls on the traitor of her marriage bed, her perfidious spouse; by grievous wrongs oppressed she invokes Themis, bride of Zeus, witness of oaths, who brought her unto Hellas, the land that fronts the strand of Asia, o'er the sea by night through ocean's boundless gate.–Translated by Reverend William T. McNiff,The Pageant of Literature: Greek and Roman WritersAnother type of play was the comedy. The most significant writer of comedies in ancient Greece was Aristophanes, whose works includedThe FrogsandThe Clouds.An Excerpt from ""The Frogs""Enter Dionysus on foot dressed in the skin of the Nemean Lion, and the club of Heracles in his hand, and Xanthias heavily laden on a donkey.XanthiasMaster, should I tell one of those usual jokes which always make the audience laugh?DionysusBy Zeus, say what you want--except ""I'm hard pressed."" Forget that one, it's really quite annoying.XanthiasNothing else witty either?DionysusAnything but ""What a strain!""XanthiasWhat then? Can I say the really funny one?DionysusOf course,Go right ahead--but don't let me catch you saying this.XanthiasWhat's that?DionysusThat you must shift your pack to ease yourself.XanthiasWell, can't I say I've got such a load on me, unless someone takes it off, I'll bust a gut?DionysusPlease don't, unless you wish to make me sick.XanthiasSo why should I have to carry all this stuff,without doing any of the jokes that Phrynichus and Lycis and Ameipsias always make the baggage-carriers say in all their comedies?DionysusJust don't. Since when I'm in the theater and hear any of these stupid jokes, I go away just older by a year.XanthiasAlas, poor wretched me! My neck is really strained, but can't crack the joke.DionysusNow is this not outrage and utter insolence, That I myself, Dionysos, son of Winejug, must walk, and let this fellow ride, so he might feel no pain and bear no burden?XanthiasWhat? I bear no burden?DionysusHow can you bear anything? You're riding.XanthiasBut I've got all this!DionysusHow so?XanthiasMost heavily!DionysusThe weight you carry--isn't it carried by the donkey?XanthiasAbsolutely not; not what I'm holding and carrying.DionysusHow can you carry, for God's sake, when you yourself are carried by another?XanthiasI don't know, but my shoulder's sure hard pressed.DionysusWell, since you say the donkey doesn't help,Suppose you take your turn, and carry him.XanthiasUnhappy wretch! Why didn't I join the navy? Then I'd tell you to whistle a different tune!DionysusYou scoundrel, get on down! Here's the doorI'm walking to, the first placeI must stop.--Ho, porter! porter there, I say.–Translated by Reverend William T. McNiff,The Pageant of Literature: Greek and Roman WritersHis plays were witty and sarcastic. More often than not, comedies poked fun and made light of the major political figures of the day. Fortunately, the government of Athens tolerated this style of criticism.Art and ArchitectureOne popular form of Greek art was pottery. Vases, vessels, and kraters served both practical and aesthetic purposes. This krater depicts Helios, the sun god, and dates from the 5th century BCE. Image courtesy of us history.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The arts reflect the society that creates them. Nowhere is this truer than in the case of the ancient Greeks. Through their temples, sculpture, and pottery, the Greeks incorporated a fundamental principle of their culture:arete.To the Greeks,aretemeant excellence and reaching one's full potential.Ancient Greek art emphasized the importance and accomplishments of human beings. Even though much of Greek art was meant to honor the gods, those very gods were created in the image of humans.Much artwork was government sponsored and intended for public display. Therefore, art and architecture were a tremendous source of pride for citizens and could be found in various parts of the city. Typically, a city-state set aside a high-altitude portion of land for an acropolis, an important part of the city-state that was reserved for temples or palaces. The Greeks held religious ceremonies and festivals as well as significant political meetings on the acropolis.The Parthenon was built in honor of the goddess Athena, who represented the human aspiration for knowledge and the ideal of wisdom. Photograph by Martin Gray, www.sacredsites.com, posted on ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Greek Excellence: The AcropolisIn ancient Athens, Pericles ordered the construction of several major temples on the acropolis. Among these was a temple, the Parthenon, which many consider the finest example of Greek architecture.Built as a tribute to Athena, the goddess of wisdom for whom the city-state Athens was named, the Parthenon is a marvel of design, featuring massive columns contrasting with subtle details.Three different types of columns can be found in ancient Greek architecture. Whether the Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian style was used depended on the region and the purpose of the structure being built. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Many barely noticeable enhancements to the design of the Parthenon contribute to its overall beauty and balance. For example, each column is slightly wider in the middle than at its base and top. The columns are also spaced closer together near the corners of the temple and farther apart toward the middle. In addition, the temple's steps curve somewhat — lower on the sides and highest in the middle of each step.Sadly, time has not treated the Parthenon well. In the 17th century, the Turks, who had conquered the Greeks, used the Parthenon to store ammunition. An accidental explosion left the Parthenon with no roof and in near ruin. In later years, tourists hauled away pieces of the Parthenon as vacation souvenirs.Beauty in the Human FormAncient Greek sculptures were typically made of either stone or wood and very few of them survive to this day. Most Greek sculpture was of the freestanding, human form (even if the statue was of a god) and many sculptures were nudes. The Greeks saw beauty in the naked human body.Early Greek statues calledkouroswere rigid and stood up straight. Over time, Greek statuary adopted a more natural, relaxed pose with hips thrust to one side, knees and arms slightly bent, and the head turned to one side.Other sculptures depicted human action, especially athletics. A good example is Myron's ""Discus Thrower."" Another famous example is a sculpture of Artemis the huntress.The piece, called ""Diana of Versailles,"" depicts the goddess of the hunt reaching for an arrow while a stag leaps next to her.Among the most famous Greek statues is the Venus de Milo, which was created in the second century BCE. The sculptor is unknown, though many art historians believe Praxiteles to have created the piece. This sculpture embodies the Greek ideal of beauty.The ancient Greeks also painted, but very little of their work remains. The most enduring paintings were those found decorating ceramic pottery. Two major styles include red figure (against a black background) and black figure (against a red background) pottery. The pictures on the pottery often depicted heroic and tragic stories of gods and humans.ThinkersThis painting, The Death of Socrates, by the 18th-century artist, David, portrays the famous story of Socrates' death. He was convicted of religious heresy and contamination of the youth and died by drinking hemlock after the people of Athens turned against him. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The citizens of Athens were fed up with the old ""wise"" man.Socrates, one of ancient Greece's most learned philosophers, found himself on trial for his teachings. The prosecution accused Socrates of corrupting the youth of Athens. A jury of hundreds found Socrates guilty and sentenced him to death.At the age of 70, Socrates willingly drank hemlock, a powerful poison that put an end to his controversial life. How did it happen that Athenians put to death a great philosopher such as Socrates?In the Renaissance artist, Raphael's School of Athens, Plato (shown on the left) argues that one should search for truth from above, while his pupil Aristotle argues that answers can be found through observation on Earth. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Throughout his entire life, Socrates questioned everything from Athenian government to Greek religion and the gods themselves. His ultimate goal was finding the truth, which he believed could be reached through reason and knowledge. Socrates was a teacher, but he did not have a classroom, any books, or even a school. Instead, Socrates lectured publicly. Anyone interested in what he had to say was invited to listen.Socrates practiced a style of teaching that has since become known as the Socratic method. Essentially, Socrates taught through questioning. He started with simple questions, then progressed to more complex, deeper questions. Through the application of reason and logic, Socrates revealed answers to many questions that led to a greater understanding of the world.Problems arose because Socrates often questioned the very fundamentals and traditions of Greek society. His constant questioning and searching for the truth were seen as dangerous by many and ultimately led to his death.Plato's RepublicPlato, a student of Socrates, also achieved greatness as a philosopher. Unlike Socrates, however, Plato chose to write his ideas down. In one of his most renowned works,The Republic, Plato outlined his vision of the ideal state.Greek philosophers were quite prolific, and left behind many wonderful dialogues on life, morality, death, and religion. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Surprisingly, Plato's republic was not very democratic. Plato was greatly disturbed at the way the mass of Athenians had agreed to put to death his brilliant teacher and mentor, Socrates. Plato believed that uneducated people should not have right to make important decisions for everyone.Instead, Plato envisioned a society with many classes in which each class contributed what it could. In his ideal society, farmers grew the food for the republic, soldiers defended the republic, and a class of intelligent, educated philosophers ruled the republic. Not surprisingly, Plato lived at a time when democratic society in Athens was in decline.Such then, I said, are our principles of theology --some tales are to be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to value friendship with one another.Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?Certainly not, he said.And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?Impossible.Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.That will be our duty, he said.Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages, beginning with the verses...Plato, ""The Republic,"" (360 B.C.E.), Book III excerpt, translated by Benjamin JowettOne of Plato's students, Aristotle, also distinguished himself as a thinker. Aristotle wrote about and studied many subjects, including biology, physics, metaphysics, literature, ethics, logic, art, and more. He emphasized the importance of observation and the gathering of data.Although Aristotle made important discoveries in many areas, his explanation concerning the movement of heavenly bodies was wrong. Aristotle believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth. This makes sense from a strictly observational standpoint. Looking up at the sky, it looked to Aristotle like everything (sun, moon, stars) circled the earth. In this case, Aristotle's reliance on observation led him astray. In reality, the Earth revolves on its own axis, causing the illusion of it being the center of everything.A Golden Age of ThoughtBesides the three great philosophers described above, ancient Greece produced many other important thinkers. In the realm of science, Hippocrates applied logic to the field of medicine and collected information on hundreds of patients. His work helped advance people's understanding of the causes of disease and death and swayed people from believing in supernatural reasons.Greek thinkers applied logic to mathematics as well. Pythagoras deduced multiplication tables as well as the Pythagorean theorem relating to right triangles. Euclid revolutionized the field of geometry, and Archimedes worked with the force of gravity and invented an early form of calculus.In the realm of the social sciences, Herodotus, is often credited with being the first modern historian. Another historian, Thucydides, tried to be as objective as possible in reporting the history he recorded.Many of these advancements and revelations seem obvious by today's standards. But 2,500 years ago, most humans were concerned with providing food and protection for their families and little else. Most of them were ruled by kings or pharaohs who had supreme decision-making power. The Athenian democracy encouraged countless innovative thoughts among its citizens.To the ancient Greeks, thinking was serious business.Alexander the GreatAlexander the Great was so impressed by the Indian use of elephants in battle, that he immediately enlisted them into his army. Elephants were particularly effective against horses, which would often bolt away in fear at the presence of the enormous beasts. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Was Alexander the Great really great?A great conqueror, in 13 short years he amassed the largest empire in the entire ancient world — an empire that covered 3,000 miles. And he did this without the benefit of modern technology and weaponry. In his day, troop movements were primarily on foot, and communications were face to face. Not bad for a kid who became the King of Macedon at the age of 20.Many of Alexander's accomplishments were made possible by his father, Philip of Macedon. Macedon, which existed roughly where the modern country of Macedonia lies today, was a kingdom located that lay geographically north of the Greek city-states.Alexander's the Great's tutor was the Greek philosopher Aristotle.In 338 BCE, King Philip of Macedon invaded and conquered the Greek city-states. Philip took advantage of the fact that the Greek city-states were divided by years of squabbling and infighting. Philip succeeded in doing what years of fighting between city-states had not done. He united Greece.Conquering the WorldPhilip's next goal was to defeat Greece's age-old enemy to the east: Persia. For years, the massive Persian Empire threatened the very existence of the Greek way of life. But before he was able to pursue his second goal, Philip was assassinated.This map shows Alexander the Great's massive empire and the route he took to conquer it.When his son, Alexander, took the throne in 336 BCE, he vowed to complete his father's plans. In 334 BCE, Alexander invaded Persia, which lay across the Aegean Sea in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).After three grueling years of warfare and three decisive battles, Alexander smashed the Persian armies at the Tigris River and conquered the mighty Persian Empire, including the legendary city of Babylon. For many Greeks, this victory marked a moment of sweet revenge against a bitter foe.Alexander was an amazing soldier who led his army to conquer much of the known world. ""Alexander"" by John J. Popovic, (1stMuse.com), courtesy of ushistory.com, licensed under CC by 4.0.At this point, at the age of 25, Alexander ruled an expansive empire. Nevertheless, his ambitions were not satisfied. While fighting the Persians, Alexander conquered Egypt and founded a city at the mouth of the Nile River. This city, which he named Alexandria after himself, became a cosmopolitan, diverse, bustling center of trade, the arts, and ideas.But Alexander was not done. He continued his campaign, driving farther east, until he reached India and the Indus River in 326 BCE. At this point, his exhausted troops refused to fight further. They told Alexander that a truly great leader knows when it is time to stop fighting.Without the support of his army, Alexander had no choice but to turn back and begin consolidating and organizing his far-flung empire. On his way home, Alexander died from disease in 323 BCE.Though he was an unquestionably skilled and highly respected military leader, Alexander the Great was feared by those around him for his paranoia and dangerous temper. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.Alexander in HindsightAlexander the Great's legacy is both far reaching and profound. First, his father was able to unite the Greek city-states, and Alexander destroyed the Persian Empire forever. More importantly, Alexander's conquests spread Greek culture, also known as Hellenism, across his empire.In fact, Alexander's reign marked the beginning of a new era known as the Hellenistic Age because of the powerful influence that Greek culture had on other people. Without Alexander's ambition, Greek ideas and culture might well have remained confined to Greece.Many historians see Alexander the Great in a different light. Although Alexander was both intelligent and handsome, he also had a darker side. He possessed a ferocious temper and from time to time would arbitrarily murder close advisors and even friends. Also, toward the end of his many campaigns, he senselessly slaughtered thousands whose only crime was being in his way.Was Alexander the Great really great?The Olympic GamesMyron's Discobolos (Discus Thrower) shows the Greek emphasis on the beauty of the human form. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.The ancient Greeks loved competition of all sorts. Each year, the various city-states of Greece sent athletes to festivals of games, which were held to honor the gods.The most important and prestigious were the games held at Olympia to honor Zeus, the king of the gods. These Olympic games took place in the summer only once every four years.The earliest recorded Olympics occurred in 776 BCE. It is very likely, however, that Olympic games took place for hundreds of years before then.The last ancient games were held in 394 CE. Then the Romans, who had conquered the Greeks, outlawed them. The modern Olympic games began in 1896.The CompetitorsThe discus was one of the original events in the ancient Olympic games. Each thrower used the same discus for the competition — a copper one which was kept in Olympia. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.In the beginning, the participants in the Olympic games were all men. Women were not allowed to compete or even to watch.Over time, the Greeks held a festival of games to honor the goddess Hera, Zeus's wife. Only unmarried women could participate in the competitions, which consisted mainly of foot races. Eventually, women were able to participate in and attend the Olympic games.Contestants could compete in many different events. Athletes were completely naked and covered in oil as they competed. First, there were the four types of running events. Distances covered include 192 meters (the length of the stadium), 384 meters and a long-distance run of anywhere between 1,344 and 4,608 meters.Wrestling in the ancient Olympics was an honorable, but extremely difficult sport in which to compete. In addition to have no weight classes (the bigger the better!) there was no stopping the match until one man could be declared triakter (victor). Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.In the most demanding event runners raced between 384-768 meters — in an armor outfit that weighed between 50 and 70 pounds!Then, there were the combative events, boxing and wrestling. Boxers wrapped their hands in leather and metal, making the contests brutal and bloody. The object in wrestling was to touch the opponent's shoulders to the ground. All these skills were considered important for military training.Next, there were the equestrian events, which involved horses and sometimes chariots and took place in a separate arena called the hippodrome.Finally, there was the most prestigious and important of all events: the pentathlon, a combination of five different events. Each contestant threw the javelin, did the long jump, wrestled, ran a foot race, and threw the discus. The person who had the best overall effort in all these five events was declared the winner.War and PeaceAt the Olympics, the winners received wreaths made of olive leaves. Over time, more and more prizes were added such as a bronze tripod or olive oil. Winners received even greater rewards when they returned to their home city-states.In the Olympic event of the pankration — a brutal mix of boxing and wrestling with almost no rules — the combatants literally fought tooth and nail. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.Triumphant athletes were given not only large monetary awards, but also free meals for the rest of their lives. The citizens and leaders of the city-state took great pride in their athletes and publicized their accomplishments far and wide.During the Olympics, leaders from the various city-states discussed important political and economic matters. In the ancient world, major leaders rarely met the same place at the same time. As the games approached, everyone generally agreed to an Olympic truce, a time when warfare usually ceased. Athletes and spectators were granted immunity to travel to and from the games.In 2004, the Summer Games returned to their original birthplace of Athens, Greece.Video AssignmentInteractive Notebook AssignmentsConduct a SPICES analysis AncientGreece.Complete a SPICES chart and identify at least three characteristics for each category in the SPICES acronym.Create a time capsule of Greece.The time capsule should include at least 10 artifacts that represent the political, cultural, and social characteristics of Ancient Greece.Write a one page explanation of the importance of the artifacts for someone opening the time capsule.Create a Graphic Organizer identifying the major developments of Ancient Greece.ReviewQuestionsHow did geography influence Ancient Greece?What influence did the Minoans have on the development of Greek culture?How and why did Athens and Sparta arrive at different forms of government?What were the characteristics of Athenian democracy?

Nurse 'Tis a house no more; all that is passed away long since; a royal bride keeps Jason at her side, while our mistress pines away in her bower, finding no comfort for her soul in aught her friends can say. Medea (from within) Oh, oh! Would that Heaven's levin bolt would cleave this head in twain! What gain is life to me?Woe, woe is me! O, to die and win release, quitting this loathed existence! Chorus Didst hear, O Zeus, thou earth, and thou, O light, the piteous note of woe the hapless wife is uttering? How shall a yearning for that insatiate resting-place ever hasten for thee, poor reckless one, the end that death alone can bring? Never pray for that. And if thy lord prefers a fresh love, be not angered with him for that; Zeus will judge 'twixt thee and him herein. Then mourn not for thy husband's loss too much, nor waste thyself away. Medea (from within) Great Themis, and husband of Themis, behold what I am suffering now, though I did bind that accursed one, my husband, by strong oaths to me! O, to see him and his bride some day brought to utter destruction, they and their house with them, for that they presume to wrong me thus unprovoked. O my father, my country, that I have left to my shame, after slaying my own brother. Nurse Do ye hear her words, how loudly she adjures Themis, oft invoked, and Zeus, whom men regard as keeper of their oaths? On no mere trifle surely will our mistress spend her rage. Chorus Would that she would come forth for us to see, and listen to the words of counsel we might give, if haply she might lay aside the fierce fury of her wrath, and her temper stern. Never be my zeal at any rate denied my friends! But go thou and bring her hither outside the house, and tell her this our friendly thought; haste thee ere she do some mischief to those inside the house, for this sorrow of hers is mounting high. Nurse This will I do; but I doubt whether I shall persuade my mistress; still willingly will I undertake this trouble for you; albeit, she glares upon her servants with the look of a lioness with cubs, whenso anyone draws nigh to speak to her. Wert thou to call the men of old time rude uncultured boors thou wouldst not err, seeing that they devised their hymns for festive occasions, for banquets, and to grace the board, a pleasure to catch the ear, shed o'er our life, but no man hath found a way to allay hated grief by music and the minstrel's varied strain, whence arise slaughters and fell strokesof fate to o'erthrow the homes of men. And yet this were surely a gain, to heal men's wounds by music's spell, but why tune they their idle song where rich banquets are spread? For of itself doth the rich banquet, set before them, afford to men delight. Chorus I heard a bitter cry of lamentation! loudly, bitterly she calls on the traitor of her marriage bed, her perfidious spouse; by grievous wrongs oppressed she invokes Themis, bride of Zeus, witness of oaths, who brought her unto Hellas, the land that fronts the strand of Asia, o'er the sea by night through ocean's boundless gate.          –Translated by Reverend William T. McNiff, The Pageant of Literature: Greek and Roman Writers Xanthias Master, should I tell one of those usual jokes which always make the audience laugh? Dionysus By Zeus, say what you want--except ""I'm hard pressed."" Forget that one, it's really quite annoying. Xanthias Nothing else witty either? Dionysus Anything but ""What a strain!"" Xanthias What then? Can I say the really funny one? Dionysus Of course,Go right ahead--but don't let me catch you saying this. Xanthias What's that? Dionysus That you must shift your pack to ease yourself. Xanthias Well, can't I say I've got such a load on me, unless someone takes it off, I'll bust a gut? Dionysus Please don't, unless you wish to make me sick. Xanthias So why should I have to carry all this stuff,without doing any of the jokes that Phrynichus and Lycis and Ameipsias always make the baggage-carriers say in all their comedies? Dionysus Just don't. Since when I'm in the theater and hear any of these stupid jokes, I go away just older by a year. Xanthias Alas, poor wretched me! My neck is really strained, but can't crack the joke. Dionysus Now is this not outrage and utter insolence, That I myself, Dionysos, son of Winejug, must walk, and let this fellow ride, so he might feel no pain and bear no burden? Xanthias What? I bear no burden? Dionysus How can you bear anything? You're riding. Xanthias But I've got all this! Dionysus How so? Xanthias Most heavily! Dionysus The weight you carry--isn't it carried by the donkey? Xanthias Absolutely not; not what I'm holding and carrying. Dionysus How can you carry, for God's sake, when you yourself are carried by another? Xanthias I don't know, but my shoulder's sure hard pressed. Dionysus Well, since you say the donkey doesn't help,Suppose you take your turn, and carry him. Xanthias Unhappy wretch! Why didn't I join the navy? Then I'd tell you to whistle a different tune! Dionysus You scoundrel, get on down! Here's the doorI'm walking to, the first placeI must stop.--Ho, porter! porter there, I say.          –Translated by Reverend William T.

Such then, I said, are our principles of theology --some tales are to be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to value friendship with one another.
Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.
But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?
Certainly not, he said.
And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and terrible?
Impossible.
Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.
That will be our duty, he said.
Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages, beginning with the verses...Plato, ""The Republic,"" (360 B.C.E.), Book III excerpt, translated by Benjamin Jowett

Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The Romans built an empire of gigantic proportions. At its height, it encompassed nearly the entire European continent as well as parts of the Middle East and Africa.The Roman Empire's tentacles stretched from England to Egypt, from Spain to Iraq, and from southern Russia to Morocco. More significantly, ancient Roman civilization thrived for nearly one thousand years. The influence of the Romans over all of those peoples over that span of time defies measure.After adopting Christianity in the fourth century CE, the Romans spread it to every corner of their empire. They also brought their brand of law and order to all of the territories that they conquered. Latin, the language of the Romans, became the basis for several modern European languages, including Italian, French, and Spanish.At the height of its expansion (around 120 CE), the Roman Empire comprised nearly all of the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The Romans were particularly skilled in administration, organization, and engineering. They had a highly trained and disciplined military and an efficient bureaucracy. Without these qualities, the Romans would never have been able to manage their sprawling empire. They were not, however, as driven or original when it came to other intellectual pursuits.In fact, the Romans basically adopted and copied much of Greek art, literature, philosophy, and even religion. The Romans had the same set of gods as the Greeks, but with different names. In Roman mythology, Zeus became Jupiter, Hera became Juno, Ares changed to Mars, and Athena was Minerva, to name a few examples. The Romans did, however, spread these borrowed ideas everywhere they went.Romulus and RemusAccording to Roman mythology, twin brothers played an important part in the founding of Rome. These brothers, named Romulus and Remus, were the sons of Mars, the Roman god of war. Abandoned at birth, the twins were raised by a wolf.When they became older, they decided to found a city along the Tiber River near the spot where they had been abandoned. Each chose a hill upon which to begin a settlement.As often happens among brothers, disputes led to quarreling and fighting. Angered by Remus's taunting, Romulus killed his brother in a fit of rage. Romulus went on to build the city that eventually became Rome — named, of course, after Romulus.As it turned out, Romulus chose a very good spot for his city. Rome was located on the Tiber River about 15 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea. The Romans had easy access to the sea, and were somewhat protected from seaborne invasion. Also, Rome lay in the middle of the Italian peninsula, the boot-shaped landmass to the west of Greece. From this central position, the Romans could easily access and control all of what is today the modern country of Italy.Finally, the Italian peninsula's central location within the Mediterranean Sea made it possible for the Romans to trade and communicate with every part of the Mediterranean world.The Roman RepublicThe Romans established a form of government — a republic — that was copied by countries for centuries In fact, the government of the United States is based partly on Rome's model.The ladder to political power in the Roman Senate was different for the wealthy patricians than for the lower-class plebeians. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.It all began when the Romans overthrew their Etruscan conquerors in 509 BCE. Centered north of Rome, the Etruscans had ruled over the Romans for hundreds of years.Once free, the Romans established a republic, a government in which citizens elected representatives to rule on their behalf. A republic is quite different from a democracy, in which every citizen is expected to play an active role in governing the state.Did you know?CitizenThe Roman concept of the citizen evolved during the Roman Republic and changed significantly during the later Roman Empire. After the Romans freed themselves from the Etruscans, they established a republic, and all males over 15 who were descended from the original tribes of Rome became citizens. Citizens of Rome distinguished themselves from slaves and other non-citizens by wearing a toga; most wore a white toga. During the Empire, each emperor wore a purple toga to distinguish himself as theprinceps, or ""first citizen.""Citizenship varied greatly. The full citizen could vote, marry freeborn persons, and practice commerce. Some citizens were not allowed to vote or hold public office, but maintained the other rights. A third type of citizen could vote and practice commerce, but could not hold office or marry freeborn women.In the late Republic, male slaves who were granted their freedom could become full citizens. Around 90 BCE, non-Roman allies of the Republic gained the rights of citizenship, and by 212 CE, under the Edict of Caracalla, all free people of the Roman Empire could become citizens.Frescoes line the walls of long-forgotten Etruscan tombs. This painting, found in the Tomb of Augurs in Tarquinia, is titled Hell's Door. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The aristocracy (wealthy class) dominated the early Roman Republic. In Roman society, the aristocrats were known as patricians. The highest positions in the government were held by two consuls, or leaders, who ruled the Roman Republic. A senate composed of patricians elected these consuls. At this time, lower-class citizens, or plebeians, had virtually no say in the government. Both men and women were citizens in the Roman Republic, but only men could vote.Tradition dictated that patricians and plebeians should be strictly separated; marriage between the two classes was even prohibited. Over time, the plebeians elected their own representatives, called tribunes, who gained the power to veto measures passed by the senate.Gradually, the plebeians obtained even more power and eventually could hold the position of consul. Despite these changes, though, the patricians were still able to use their wealth to buy control and influence over elected leaders.The Roman SenateThe history of the Roman Senate goes as far back as the history of Rome itself. It was first created as a 100-member advisory group for the Roman kings. Later kings expanded the group to 300 members. When the kings were expelled from Rome and the Republic was formed, the Senate became the most powerful governing body. Instead of advising the head of state, it elected the chief executives, called consuls.Senators were, for centuries, strictly from the patrician class. They practiced the skills of rhetoric and oratory to persuade other members of the ruling body. The Senate convened and passed laws in the curia, a large building on the grounds of the Roman Forum. Much later, Julius Caesar built a larger curia for an expanded Senate.By the third century BCE, Rome had conquered vast territories, and the powerful senators sent armies, negotiated terms of treaties, and had total control over the financial matters of the Republic.Senatorial control was eventually challenged by Dictator Sulla around 82 BCE. Sulla had hundreds of senators murdered, increased the Senate's membership to 600, and installed many nonpatricians as senators. Julius Caesar raised the number to 900 (it was reduced after his assassination). After the creation of the Roman Empire in 27 BCE, the Senate became weakened under strong emperors who often forcefully coerced this ruling body. Although it survived until the fall of Rome, the Roman Senate had become merely a ceremonial body of wealthy, intelligent men with no power to rule.Occasionally, an emergency situation (such as a war) arose that required the decisive leadership of one individual. Under these circumstances, the Senate and the consuls could appoint a temporary dictator to rule for a limited time until the crisis was resolved. The position of dictator was very undemocratic in nature. Indeed, a dictator had all the power, made decisions without any approval, and had full control over the military.The best example of an ideal dictator was a Roman citizen named Cincinnatus. During a severe military emergency, the Roman Senate called Cincinnatus from his farm to serve as dictator and to lead the Roman army. When Cincinnatus stepped down from the dictatorship and returned to his farm only 15 days after he successfully defeated Rome's enemies, the republican leaders resumed control over Rome.The Twelve TablesOne of the innovations of the Roman Republic was the notion of equality under the law. In 449 BCE, government leaders carved some of Rome's most important laws into 12 great tablets. The Twelve Tables, as they came to be known, were the first Roman laws put in writing. Although the laws were rather harsh by today's standards, they did guarantee every citizen equal treatment under the law.Laws from the Twelve TablesFemales shall remain in guardianship even when they have attained their maturity (except Vestal Virgins).A spendthrift is forbidden to exercise administration over his own goods.It is permitted to gather fruit falling down on another man's farm.If any person has sung or composed against another person a song such as was causing slander or insult to another, he shall be clubbed to death.Quickly kill a dreadfully deformed child.Did you know?Vestal virgins (LatinVestales) were the priestesses of the Roman goddess of the hearth, Vesta, in the state religion of ancient Rome. At varying times, there were four to six priestesses employed. They were the only full-time clergy (collegia) of a Roman deity. They tended the sacred fire in the shrine of Vesta in the Roman Forum and performed other rites associated with the goddess such as caring for the sacred objects in the shrine and inner sanctuary, preparing ritual food and officiating at public events during the yearly Vestal, Vesta's feast days (June 7-15). They also ritually prepared the herbs sprinkled on sacrifices and made the bread (pane) which was offered on feast days such as March 1st, which was the Roman New Year.The virgins were chosen between the ages of six and ten years old by the chief priest and had to serve for 30 years (during which time, they, of course, had to remain chaste). Once their 30 years of service was completed, they were free to marry, but very few did as it was considered unlucky since they had, essentially, been the brides of Vesta for most of their lives and were consecrated to the goddess.If a Vestal Virgin failed in her duties, she was severely beaten and the punishment for loss of virginity was being buried alive, though other, worse punishments were sometimes given such as having molten lead poured down one's throat. Even so, the Vestal Virgins were honored by the community, had most of their needs provided for by temple tithes, and were free of many of the restrictions Roman women had to endure. It was, in fact, because they were so highly regarded that the punishment of breaking their vows was so severe.For more information, visitVestal Virgins.With respect to the law and citizenship, the Romans took a unique approach to the lands that they conquered. Rather than rule those people as conquered subjects, the Romans invited them to become citizens. These people then became a part of Rome, rather than enemies fighting against it. Naturally, these new citizens received the same legal rights as everyone else.The Punic WarsThe early Roman Republic often found itself in a state of constant warfare with its surrounding neighbors. In one instance, when the Romans were fighting the Carthaginians, Rome was nearly conquered. The people of Carthage (a city in what is today Tunisia in north Africa) were a successful trading civilization whose interests began to conflict with those of the Romans.The two sides fought three bloody wars, known as the Punic Wars (264-146 BCE), over the control of trade in the western Mediterranean Sea. In the second war, Hannibal, a Carthaginian general, successfully invaded Italy by leading an army — complete with elephants — across the Alps. He handed the Roman army a crushing defeat but was unable to sack the city of Rome itself. After occupying and ravaging Italy for more than a decade, Hannibal was finally defeated by the Roman general Scipio at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE.Why ""Punic""?How did the word ""Punic"" become an adjective meaning ""relating to the people of Carthage""? ""Punic"" is derived from the Latin wordPoenicus,meaning ""an inhabitant of Carthage."" Carthage was founded by Phoenicians, andPoenicusis the Latin word for ""Phoenician.""By the Third Punic War, Rome was ready to end the Carthaginian threat for good. After a successful several-year siege of Carthage, the Romans burned the city to the ground. Legend has it that the Romans then poured salt into the soil so that nothing would ever grow there again. Carthage was finally defeated, and the Roman Republic was safe.Julius CaesarJulius Caesar's military might, political savvy, and diplomatic genius made him supremely popular among the Roman citizenry. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The first conspirator greeted Caesar, then plunged a knife into his neck. Other stabbers followed suit. One by one, several members of the Senate took turns stabbing Julius Caesar (100-44 BCE), the dictator of the entire Roman Empire.Stunned that even his good friend Brutus was in on the plot, Caesar choked out his final words: ""'kai su, teknon?"" (""You too, my child?"").On the steps of the Senate, the most powerful man in the ancient world died in a pool of his own blood.About ""Et tu, Brute?""Roman soldiers' appearance changed very little over the centuries. The army of Julius Caesar looked very similar to the soldiers in this second-century BCE carving. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.In William Shakespeare's playJulius Caesar, the title character manages to utter ""Et tu, Brute?"" (""and you, Brutus?"") as he is slain. This is not historically accurate.According to the first century CE Roman historian Suetonius, Julius Caesar spoke mainly Greek and not Latin, as was the case with most patricians at the time. In his history about the life of Julius Caesar, Suetonius writes that as the assassins plunged their daggers into the dictator, Caesar saw Brutus and spoke the Greek phrasekai su, teknon, meaning ""you too, my child.""There is still debate whether or not it was shouted in shock or said as a warning. On one hand, Caesar may have been amazed to find a close friend like Brutus trying to kill him; on the other hand, he may have meant that Brutus would pay for his crime in the future for this treachery. Either way, the words were Greek, so leave ""Et tu, Brute"" for Shakespeare.Roman coins celebrated Caesar's military victories in Gaul (present-day France). Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Long before Julius Caesar became dictator (from 47-44 BCE) and was subsequently murdered, the Roman Republic had entered a state of rapid decline. The rich had become wealthier and more powerful as a result of Rome's many military successes.Meanwhile, life for the average Roman seemed to be getting worse. Attempts to reform the situation by two brothers, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, were met with opposition that eventually resulted in their deaths.Julius Caesar led his Roman legions as far north as Britain in 55 BCE. He and his army may have seen this view upon landing at Deal Beach.

Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Did you know?A Revolting DevelopmentSpartacus (109-71 BCE) was a captured soldier who was sold into slavery to be a gladiator. But he escaped his captors and formed an army of rebel slaves. Against great odds, Spartacus's slave army defeated two Roman battalions.Spartacus wanted to leave Italy, but his army and supporters of the slave revolt urged him to attack Rome. A Roman army led by Crassus finally defeated Spartacus and his men.More than 5,000 men from Spartacus's army were crucified along Rome's main road, the Appian Way, as a warning to other slaves not to revolt.Finally, a new practice developed in which the army was paid with gold and land. Soldiers no longer fought for the good of the Republic but fought instead for tangible rewards. Gradually, soldiers became more loyal to the generals who could pay them than to the Roman Republic itself. It was within this changing atmosphere that military leaders such as Julius Caesar were able to seize control of and put an end to the Roman Republic.Julius Caesar was a man of many talents. Born into the patrician class, Caesar was intelligent, educated, and cultivated. An excellent speaker, he possessed a sharp sense of humor, charm, and personality. All of these traits combined helped make him a skilled politician.Moreover, Caesar was a military genius. His many successful military campaigns gained him broad support and popularity among the common people. Caesar also won the undying loyalty of his soldiers, who supplied him with the necessary muscle to seize power.Julius Caesar began his rise to power in 60 BCE by forging an alliance with another general, Pompey, and a wealthy patrician, Crassus. Together, these three men assumed control of the Roman Republic, and Caesar was thrust into the position of consul. Historians have since dubbed the period of rule by these three men the First Triumvirate.Over time, however, the triumvirate broke down. Crassus was killed in battle, and Pompey began entertaining ideas of ruling without the dangerously popular Caesar. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul (modern-day France), Pompey and the Senate ordered Caesar to return to Rome without his army. But when Caesar crossed the Rubicon River in northern Italy, he brought his army with him in defiance of the senate's order. This fateful decision led to a civil war. Caesar defeated Pompey's forces and entered Rome in 46 BCE, triumphant and unchallenged.Upon his return, Caesar made himself dictator and absolute ruler of Rome and its territories. During his rule, he enacted several reforms. Caesar founded many colonies in newly conquered territories and provided land and opportunity for poor Romans who chose to migrate there. He reduced the number of slaves and opened citizenship up to people living in the provinces. Finally, he created a new calendar named the Julian calendar. This very calendar, with a few minor adjustments, is the same one used around the world today.In 44 BCE, Julius Caesar ordered the Senate to make him dictator for life. Typically, dictators served for a limited time (usually six months), then stepped down. Caesar's actions threatened to end the Republic once and for all. Fearing this change, a group of senators plotted and executed the murder of Caesar on the Ides of March. Although the senators succeeded in ending Caesar's life, they did not realize at that time that the Republic had died with him.Rome would now become an empire.Timeline for General Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BCE)100Born in Rome84Marries Cornelia, daughter of the powerful consul Cinna75Captured and ransomed by Mediterranean pirates.

During the Pax Romana, the Roman Empire reached its peak in terms of land area, and its population swelled to an estimated 70 million people.This map depicts the Roman Empire in 117 CE, at the height of the Pax Romana. This image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Nevertheless, Rome's citizens were relatively secure, and the government generally maintained law, order, and stability. The Pax Romana began when Octavian became the leader of the Roman Empire.Civil War and MoreAfter the murder of Julius Caesar, a period of civil war erupted in Rome. Out of this turmoil emerged the Second Triumvirate, consisting of Lepidus, Antony, and Octavian, who was Julius Caesar's nephew. This new triumvirate ruled Rome for a decade, but as happened with the First Triumverate, differences among the leaders eventually emerged.The romance between Antony and Cleopatra has inspired the imaginations of artists for a millennium. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.Octavian defeated Lepidus in battle, and then turned his armies against the more powerful Mark Antony. Antony had fallen in love with and married the spellbinding queen of Egypt, Cleopatra. At the Battle of Actium off the coast of Greece in 31 BCE, Octavian's navy defeated the navy of Antony and Cleopatra, who later both committed suicide.Octavian returned to Rome triumphant and gave himself the title of princeps or ""the first."" Octavian was careful not to upset the Senate by declaring himself dictator as his uncle Julius Caesar had done. Even though Octavian ruled as a de facto dictator, he maintained the Senate and other institutions of the republican government.In 27 BCE, the Senate bestowed the holy title of Augustus upon Octavian. Augustus, as he became known, ruled for 41 years, and the policies he enacted lay the groundwork for the peace and stability of the Pax Romana.All Roads Lead to RomeThe 200 years of the Pax Romana saw many advances and accomplishments, particularly in engineering and the arts. To help maintain their sprawling empire, the Romans built an extensive system of roads. These durable road facilitated the movement of troops and communication. The Romans built aqueducts to carry water overland to cities and farms.The Roman army built the roads that connected the vast Roman empire. By layering sand, cement, and stone, they created durable roads that lasted long after the fall of Rome.

Concrete made possible the creation of huge rounded arches and domes.One of the most famous structures built during the Pax Romana, the Pantheon in Rome, has one of the largest freestanding domes in the world to this day.During the Pax Romana, many of Rome's finest writers (such as Horace, Virgil, Ovid, and Livy) produced literary and poetic masterpieces. Rome became the economic, political, and cultural capital of the entire Western world.Caligula's bizarre and sometimes sadistic behavior eventually led to his assassination in 41 CE.

One emperor, Caligula, was mentally ill and regularly abused his power. He was so sensitive about his baldness that he prohibited anyone from looking down upon his head and shaved some people who had a full heads of hair.Caligula was a vicious sadist who took great pleasure in watching people being put to death. In fact, he often requested that killings be prolonged as much as possible. Caligula also had a tremendous sexual appetite and committed incest with his sisters.""Consider when thou art much vexed or grieved, that man's life is only a moment, and after a short time we are all laid out dead."" -Marcus Aurelius. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 4.0.He even invited his favorite horse to eat at formal state dinners.Eventually, his bizarre and tyrannical behavior turned the Romans against him, and in 41 CE, Caligula was assassinated by members of his own Praetorian guard.Not all emperors were unfit to rule. In fact, a series of leaders known as the Five Good Emperors ruled in succession and presided over a prolonged period of peace and prosperity.The last of these emperors, Marcus Aurelius, was the final emperor of the Pax Romana. His reign was followed by the disastrous reign of his brutal son Commodus (160-192 CE). By this time, the Empire was struggling to hold off attacking tribes on the frontiers.Life of the PeopleRomans clothing indicated social status. The man on the far right, who wears only a tunic, was probably from one of the lowest classes — a slave or a freed person. The man on the far left wears a toga, the costume of a Roman citizen.

The average citizen worked hard and lived reasonably comfortably in modest housing. Despite the riches of the Roman Empire, the largest class lived in what can only be described as poverty.Roman children wore pendants called bullas, from the Latin word for ""bubble,"" around their necks. The wealthy wore bullas made of gold, while a typical plebeian bulla was leather.

The patriarch made all of the major decisions for the family. He had the power to divorce his wife or even kill her if she committed adultery.Likewise, the patriarch had the right to kill his own children. In fact, the patriarch routinely decided if a newborn baby would survive and be raised by the family. Depending on how many children the family already had and the sex of the child, the patriarch might choose to have the baby killed. Infanticide was a widespread problem in the Empire, especially among female babies.The wife of the patriarch was expected to manage the household and to remain loyal and obedient to her husband. Women could not hold political office, but in later years of the Empire women gained more rights, such as the right to own property.Jellyfish and Fungus — Yum!A 19th century French artist captures the Roman feast in his painting ""The Romans of the Decadence."" Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The Roman diet revolved around three Mediterranean staples: grain, grapes, and olives. Everyone in the Italian peninsula ate these foods daily. The grain (mainly wheat) was used to make bread, the grapes to make wine, and the olives to make olive oil. Bread made up the majority of many meals, especially for the poor. Wine was served with almost every meal and was often mixed with water to reduce the effect of the alcohol. Olive oil provided an important source of fat.The rich ate whatever they wanted. Their tastes leaned toward the exotic. The more unusual the food seemed, the better. They ate jellyfish, peacock, ostrich, pork, and fungus, to name just a few of their favorites. The wealthy held huge banquets that lasted all day. When guests became full, they sometimes purged themselves so that they could continue eating.The diet of the poor relied on bread, vegetables such as cabbage, and porridge. The poor met their protein needs by eating some meat (usually pork) and cheese.Sports were a favorite activity of ancient Romans. This fresco depicts Roman women playing with a kind of medicine ball called paganica and even dumbbells.

Only citizens were allowed to wear togas. As togas were status markers, citizens wore them with pride, even though they were not very comfortable. The toga consisted of a very large (18 feet by 6 feet) rectangular or semicircular piece of wool cloth that was carefully draped and wrapped around the body. A properly wrapped toga required no buttons, pins, clasps, or any other fastening device.The average citizen wore a white toga, but a person in a position of importance wore a toga with a purple stripe whose appearance varied according to the significance of the person's position. The emperor's toga was completely purple.The basic item of clothing for an unmarried women was a tunic. Depending on the design of the garment it was called either a peplos or chiton. Married women wore a garment called a stola.This aqueduct, the Aqua Virgo, was built in 19 BCE to supply water to the baths near the Pantheon. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Rub-a-dub-dubTogas are no longer popular attire — except at frat parties — but some Roman practices have endured to this day. Going to a club for a workout and a sweat in the sauna, for example, was originally a Roman idea. Romans like to go to the public baths. The baths were places where men and women (separately) could go to socialize, exercise, read, and relax, as well as get clean.A typical trip to the public baths was quite an event. It might begin with some exercise in the gymnasium, followed by a trip to a warm room where an attendant would rub oil all over the visitor's body.Next came a visit to thetepidariumwhere another attendant scraped the oil, dirt, and sweat off the body with a metal tool. When clean, the Romans took a swim in the actual baths, which included both hot water pools and cold water pools. The waters of the public baths were continuously refreshed by aqueducts and heated by underground furnaces.Finally, drinking special mineral waters alleged to have healing powers completed a visit to the baths.During the entire experience, visitors to the baths interacted with fellow citizens. This social function may have been the most important purpose of the baths.Gladiators, Chariots, and the Roman GamesTwo men ready their weapons. An excited crowd of Romans cheer loudly in anticipation. Both combatants realize full well that this day might be their last. They are gladiators, men who fight to the death for the enjoyment of others.As the two gladiators circle each other, each knows that his objective is to maim or trap his opponent rather than to kill him quickly. What's more, the fight must last long enough to please the crowd.The gladiators jab swords and swing maces. They sweat in the hot sun. Sand and dirt fly. Suddenly, one gladiator traps the other with a net and poises to kill him with a three-pronged trident. The victor waits for a sign from the crowd. If the losing gladiator has put up a good fight, the crowd might choose to spare his life — and the vanquished gladiator will live to fight another day. But if the crowd is dissatisfied with the losing fighter — as was usually the case — its dissatisfaction meant slaughter.In ancient Rome, death had become a form of entertainment.Let the Games BeginBefore fighting, gladiators had to swear the following oath: ""I will endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword."" Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The Etruscans of northern Italy originally held public games, (ludi), which featured such events as gladiator battles and chariot races, as a sacrifice to the gods.The Romans continued the practice, holding games roughly 10 to 12 times in an average year. Paid for by the emperor, the games were used to keep the poor and unemployed entertained and occupied. The emperor hoped to distract the poor from their poverty in the hopes that they would not revolt.Over time, the games became more spectacular and elaborate as emperors felt compelled to outdo the previous year's competitons. The games involved more participants, occurred more frequently, and became more expensive and more outlandish.The ColosseumIn Rome, the gladiatorial contests were held in the Colosseum, a huge stadium that first opened in 80 CE. Located in the middle of the city, the Colosseum was circular in shape with three levels of arches around the outside. In height, the Colosseum was as tall as a modern 12-story building; it held 50,000 spectators.Like many modern professional sports stadiums, the Colosseum had box seats for the wealthy and powerful. The upper level was reserved for the commoners. Under the floor of the Colosseum was a labyrinth of rooms, hallways, and cages where weapons were stored and animals and gladiators waited for their turn to perform.The Colosseum was also watertight and could be flooded to hold naval battles. Special drains allowed water to be pumped in and released. But, naval battles were rarely held there because the water caused serious damage to the basic structure of the Colosseum.The Colosseum wasn't the only amphitheater in ancient Rome; there were several scattered throughout the entire empire. The amphitheater pictured above is in Tunisia, Africa. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The gladiators themselves were usually slaves, criminals, or prisoners of war. Occasionally, the gladiators were able to fight for their freedom. Criminals who were sentenced to death were sometimes thrown into the arena unarmed to serve their sentence. Some people, including women, actually volunteered to be gladiators.They were willing to risk death for the possibility of fame and glory. Many gladiators went to special schools that trained them how to fight. A few gladiators boxed. They used metal gloves to increase cutting and bleeding.Some gladiatorial contests included animals such as bears, rhinos, tigers, elephants, and giraffes. Most often, hungry animals fought other hungry animals. But sometimes hungry animals fought against gladiators in contests calledvenationes(""wild beast hunts""). On rare occasions, the animals were allowed to maul and eat a live human who was tied to a stake.This relief sculpture from the second century C.E. illustrates what a chariot race in the Circus Maximus might have looked like. The competitors completed seven intense laps in front of a crowd of 300,000. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Bread and CircusesRomans loved chariot races, which were held on special racetracks called circuses. The most famous circus, which was in Rome, was the Circus Maximus. In chariot races, two- or four-horse chariots ran seven laps totaling anywhere from three to five miles.Roman games included other types of equestrian events. Some races with horses and riders resemble today's thoroughbred horseracing. In one type of race, riders began the competition on horseback but later dismounted and ran on foot to the finish.As the Roman Empire started its decline, the author Juvenal (55-127 CE) noted, ""The people are only anxious for two things: bread and circuses.""The Fall of the Roman EmpireConstantine the Great, 306-337 CE, divided the Roman Empire in two and made Christianity the dominant religion in the region. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.The invading army reached the outskirts of Rome, which had been left totally undefended. In 410 CE, the Visigoths, led by Alaric, breached the walls of Rome and sacked the capital of the Roman Empire.The Visigoths looted, burned, and pillaged their way through the city, leaving a wake of destruction wherever they went. The plundering continued for three days. For the first time in nearly a millennium, the city of Rome was in the hands of someone other than the Romans. This was the first time that the city of Rome was sacked, but by no means the last.Constantine and the Rise of ChristianityOne of the many factors that contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire was the rise of a new religion, Christianity. The Christian religion, which was monotheistic ran counter to the traditional Roman religion, which was polytheistic (many gods). At different times, the Romans persecuted the Christians because of their beliefs, which were popular among the poor.This 16th-century medallion depicts Attila the Hun, one of the most vicious invaders of all time. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.In 313 CE, Roman emperor Constantine the Great ended all persecution and declared toleration for Christianity. Later that century, Christianity became the official state religion of the Empire. This drastic change in policy spread this relatively new religion to every corner of the Empire.By approving Christianity, the Roman state directly undermined its religious traditions. Finally, by this time, Romans considered their emperor a god. But the Christian belief in one god — who was not the emperor — weakened the authority and credibility of the emperor.Constantine enacted another change that helped accelerate the fall of the Roman Empire. In 330 CE, he split the empire into two parts: the western half centered in Rome and the eastern half centered in Constantinople, a city he named after himself.Why Two Empires?This map of the Roman Empire in 476 CE shows the various people who invaded and how they carved up the Empire. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.In 324, Constantine's army defeated the forces of Licinius, the emperor of the east. Constantine became emperor of the entire empire and founded a new capital city in the eastern half at Byzantium. The city was his New Rome and was later named Constantinople (the ""city of Constantine"").Empress Theodora was one of the most powerful women of late antiquity. She helped keep her husband, Emperor Justinian, in power and solidified the strength of the Byzantine Empire in the sixth century CE as the western Empire collapsed. Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Constantinople was advantageously situated for two reasons. First, it was on a peninsula that could be fortified and defended easily. Further, because Constantinople was located on the frontiers of the empire, imperial armies could respond more easily to external attacks or threats.Some scholars also believe that Constantine established a new city in order to provide a place for the young religion of Christianity to grow in an environment purer than that of corrupt Rome.The western Empire spoke Latin and was Roman Catholic. The eastern Empire spoke Greek and worshipped under the Eastern Orthodox branch of the Christian church. Over time, the east thrived, while the west declined. In fact, after the western part of the Roman Empire fell, the eastern half continued to exist as the Byzantine Empire for hundreds of years. Therefore, the ""fall of Rome"" really refers only to the fall of the western half of the Empire.Other fundamental problems contributed to the fall. In the economically ailing west, a decrease in agricultural production led to higher food prices. The western half of the empire had a large trade deficit with the eastern half. The west purchased luxury goods from the east but had nothing to offer in exchange. To make up for the lack of money, the government began producing more coins with less silver content. This led to inflation. Finally, piracy and attacks from Germanic tribes disrupted the flow of trade, especially in the west.There were political and military difficulties as well. It didn't help matters that political amateurs were in control of Rome in the years leading up to its fall. Army generals dominated the emperorship, and corruption was rampant. Over time, the military was transformed into a mercenary army with no real loyalty to Rome. As money grew tight, the government hired the cheaper and less reliable Germanic soldiers to fight in Roman armies. By the end, these armies were defending Rome against their fellow Germanic tribesmen. Under these circumstances, the sack of Rome came as no surprise.Goth RockersWave after wave of Germanic barbarian tribes swept through the Roman Empire. Groups such as the Visigoths, Vandals, Angles, Saxons, Franks, Ostrogoths, and Lombards took turns ravaging the Empire, eventually carving out areas in which to settle down. The Angles and Saxons populated the British Isles, and the Franks ended up in France.In 476 CE Romulus, the last of the Roman emperors in the west, was overthrown by the Germanic leader Odoacer, who became the first Barbarian to rule in Rome. The order that the Roman Empire had brought to western Europe for 1000 years was no more.Video AssignmentInteractive Notebook AssignmentsReviewQuestionsHow did geographic factors influence the culture and historical development of Rome?What were the two main forms of government that the Romans followed and what were their characteristics?How did Rome change as it shifted from a republic to an empire?What were the opportunities and limitations for women in Roman society?What privileges and power did the paterfamilias of the Roman family exercise over other members of the family?What lasting scientific, mathematical, and technological innovations originated in Rome?What were the internal and external factors that led to the fall of the Roman Empire?VocabularyChristianityA religion originating during the latter days of the Roman Empire, inspired from the teachings and later crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

[WHS.20B]Identify examples of religious influences on various events referenced in the major eras of world history. [WHS.23B]Byzantine EmpireAs the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE, the Eastern Roman Empire, centered on the city ofConstantinople, survived and thrived. Constantine moved the seat of the empire to Constantinople, creating a strategic location at the crossroads of European and Asian trade. Although the people living in the Eastern Roman Empire referred to themselves as Romans, they were distinguished by their Greek heritage, Orthodox Christianity, and their regional connections. Over time, the culture of the Eastern Roman Empire transformed. Greek replaced Latin as the language of the empire. Christianity became more important in daily life, while still coping with a sometimes-uncomfortable memory of its pagan Roman past. Regardless of the East-West division, the people of the Byzantine Empire identified themselves as Roman.After the Eastern Roman Empire fell too in 1453 CE, Western scholars began calling it the ""Byzantine Empire"" to emphasize its differences from the earlier Latin-speaking Roman Empire centered on Rome.Constantine the Great and the Beginning of ByzantiumMost scholars accept thatthe end of the Roman Empiredid not happen at one time, but that it was a slow process, and so late Roman history overlaps with early Byzantine history. Constantine I (""the Great"") is usually held to be the founder of the Byzantine Empire. He was responsible for two major changes that would help create a Byzantine culture distinct from the Roman past.First, he moved the capital of the Roman Empire to the city of Byzantium (the origin of the word ""Byzantine""), a city strategically located on the trade routes between Europe and Asia and between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, which he re-founded as the city of Constantinople (it was also sometimes called ""New Rome""). Constantine's founding of Constantinople in 330 CE is usually considered the beginning of the Byzantine Empire. By moving the capital of the empire outside Italy and east, Constantine moved the center of gravity in the empire to this region, right on the divide between Europe and Asia Minor.Second, he legalized Christianity, which had previously been persecuted in the Roman Empire. He converted to Christianity himself and sponsored the Christian Church. Though not the empire's official religion, Christianity would be a major element of Byzantine culture.After Constantine, few emperors ruled the entire Roman Empire. It was too big and was under attack from too many directions. Usually, there was an emperor of the Western Roman Empire ruling from Italy or Gaul and an emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire ruling from Constantinople. While the Western Empire was overrun by Germanic barbarians the Eastern Empire thrived. Constantinople became the largest city in the empire and a major commercial center. In 476 CE, the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed and the Western Roman Empire was no more. Thus the Eastern Roman Empire was the only Roman Empire left standing.The East - West SchismBy the turn of millennium, the Eastern Church of the Byzantine Empire and the Western Church of Rome had been gradually separating along religious fault lines for centuries. The ByzantineIconoclasm--the destruction or prohibition of religious icons and other images or monuments for religious or political motives--ignited a major controversy that lasted fora century and widened the growing divergence between east and west. The Western Church remained firmly in support of the use of religious images, though the church was still unified at this time.In addition, there were other disputes, including disagreement over the Holy Spirit, whether leavened or unleavened bread should be used in the Eucharist, and the Bishop of Rome's claim to universal jurisdiction.In response, the people in the west declared a new emperor in Charlemagne, solidifying the rift and causing outrage in the east. The empire in the west became known as the Holy Roman Empire. Finally, 1054 CE saw the East-West Schism, the formal declaration of institutional separation between east, into the Orthodox Church--now theEastern Orthodox Church--and west, into the Catholic Church--now the Roman Catholic Church.[Figure 2]Map of eastern-western allegiances in 1054 with former country borders.

He dreamed of reconquering the lands of the Western Roman Empire and ruling a single, united Roman Empire from his seat in Constantinople.Justinian sent his general, Belisarius, to Africa with a small army in 533 CE. Belisarius successfully defeated the Vandals and claimed Africa for Constantinople. Next, Justinian sent him to take Italy from the Ostrogoths in 535 CE. Belisarius defeated the Ostrogoths in a series of battles and reclaimed Rome. By 540 CE, most of Italy was in Justinian's hands. he sent another army to conquer Spain.Justinian also undertook many important projects at home. Much of Constantinople was burned down early in Justinian's reign after a series of riots called the Nika riots in 532 CE, when angry racing fans became enraged at Justinian for arresting two popular charioteers (though this was really just the last straw for a populace increasingly angry over rising taxes) and tried to depose him. The riots were put down, and Justinian set about rebuilding the city on a greater scale. His greatest accomplishment was theHagia Sophia, the most important church of the city. The Hagia Sophia was a staggering work of Byzantine architecture, intended to awe all of who set foot in the church. It was the largest church in the world for nearly a thousand years, and for the rest of the Byzantine history it was the center of Christian worship in Constantinople.Emperor Justinian's most important contribution, perhaps, was a unified Roman legal code. Prior to his reign, Roman laws had differed from region to region, and many contradicted one another. The Romans had attempted to systematize the legal code in the fifth century but had not completed the effort. Now Justinian set up a commission of lawyers to put together a single code, listing each law by subject so that it could be easily referenced. This not only served as the basis for law in the Byzantine Empire, but it was the main influence on the Catholic Church's development of canon law and went on to become the basis of law in many European countries. Justinian's law code continues to have a major influence on public international law to this day.The impact of a more unified legal code and military conflicts was the increased ability for the Byzantine Empire to establish trade and improve their economic standing. Byzantine merchants traded not only all over the Mediterranean region, but also throughout regions to the east. These included areas around the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean.A terrible plague swept through the empire, killing his wife Theodora and almost killing him. The plague wiped out huge numbers of the empire's population, leaving villages empty and crops unharvested. The army was also afflicted, and the Ostrogoths were able to effectively regain Italy in 546 CE through guerrilla warfare against the Byzantine occupiers.Justinian kept the empire from collapse. He sent a new general, Narses, to Italy with a small force. Nurses finally defeated the Ostrogoths and drove them back out of Italy. By the time the war was over, Italy, once one of the most prosperous lands the ancient world, was wrecked. The city of Rome changed hands multiple times, and most of the cities of Italy were abandoned or fell into a long period of decline. They devised Greece and the Balkans, and in the absence of strong Byzantine military might, they settled in small communities in these lands.Protection of EuropeThe Byzantine Empire had kept Greek and Roman culture alive for nearly a thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire in the west. It had preserved this cultural heritage until it was taken up in the West during the Renaissance. The Byzantine Empire had also acted as a buffer between Western Europe and the conquering armies of Islam. Thus, in many ways the Byzantine Empire had insulated Europe and given it the time it needed to recover from its chaotic medieval period.ReligionOrthodoxy now occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Bulgaria, Russia, Serbia and other countries. Following the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 CE, the Ottomans regarded themselves as the ""heirs"" of Byzantium and preserved important aspects of its tradition, which in turn facilitated an ""Orthodox revival"" during the post-communist period of the Eastern European states. The modern-day Eastern Orthodox Church is the second largest Christian church in the world.Diplomacy and LawAfter the fall of Rome, the key challenge to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbors. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modeled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbors into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings as well as the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. The preservation of the ancient civilization in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.In the field of law, Justinian I's reforms to the legal code would come to serve as the basis of not only Byzantine law but law in many European countries and continues to have a major influence on public international law to this day.  In the 10th century, Leo VI the Wise achieved the complete codification of the whole of Byzantine law in Greek, which became the foundation of all subsequent Byzantine law, which generates interest to the present day.Art and LiteratureInfluences from Byzantine architecture, particularly in religious buildings, can be found in diverse regions from Egypt and Arabia to Russia and Romania. During the Byzantine Renaissance of the Macedonian Dynasty, art and literature flourished, and artists adopted a naturalistic style and complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art, mixing them with Christian themes. Byzantine painting from this period would have a strong influence on the later painters of the Italian Renaissance. The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of the classical knowledge, as important contributors to the modern European civilization, and as precursors to both the Renaissance humanism and the Slav Orthodox culture.EconomyThe Byzantine economy was among the most advanced in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, was unable to match Byzantine economic strength until late in the Middle Ages. Constantinople was a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa. In particular, it was the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. Until the first half of the sixth century and in sharp contrast with the decaying West, the Byzantine economy was flourishing and resilient.LanguageApart from the Imperial court, administration, and military, the primary language used in the eastern Roman provinces even before the decline of the Western Empire was Greek, which had been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin arrived. (Latin would continue to be used as both a spoken language and the language of scholarship, and it would eventually evolve into the various western Romance languages). Greek became the common language in the Christian Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations.Video AssignmentsFall of the Roman Empire ...in the 15th Centuryby Crash CourseIstanbul, Turkey: Hagia Sohpiaby Rick Steves' EuropeJustinian and the ByzantineEmpire by Khan AcademyVideo Discussion QuestionsWhy were there so many Roman Emperors between 235 and 248 CE?Why was wearing pants a symbol ofbeing uncivilizedin the Roman Republic?Where is Byzantium?

Wandering tribes then began staking out permanent homes as a means of protection. Much of this resulted in fixed settlements from which many, under a powerful leader, expanded outwards.MilitaryGermanic people were fierce in battle, creating a strong military. Their love of battle was linked to their religious practices and two of the most important gods, Wodan and his son, Thor, were both believed to be gods of war. The Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by Rome and Greece and the Germanic tribes focused on raids to capture resources and secure prestige.Warriors were strong in battle and had great fighting abilities, making the tribes almost unbeatable. Men began battle training at a young age and were given a shield and a spear upon manhood, illustrating the importance of combat in Germanic life. The loss of the shield or spear meant a loss of honor. The Germanic warriors' intense devotion to his tribe and his chieftain led to many important military victories throughout their existence.Chieftains were the leaders of clans and clans were divided into groups by family ties. The earlier Germans elected the chieftain, but as time went on it became hereditary. One of the chieftains jobs was to keep peace in the clans, and they did this by keeping the warriors together and united.Military Chieftains relied upon retinues, a body of followers 'retained' by the chieftain. A chieftain's retinue might include close relatives, but it was not limited to them. The followers depended on the retinue for military  and other services and who in return provided for the retinue's needs and divided with them the spoils of battle. This relationship between a chieftain and his followers became the basis for the more complicated feudal system that developed in medieval Europe.Major Historical FiguresPolitical and diplomatic leaders, such as Odoacer and Theodoric the Great, changed the course of history in the late 400s CE and paved the way for later kings and conquerors. Odoacer, a German general, took over the Western Roman Empire in his own name, becoming the first barbarian king of Italy. Theodoric the Great, became a barbarian king of Italy after the killing of Odoacer. He initiated three decades of peace between the Ostrogoths and the Romans and united the two Gothic tribes.Theoderic the Great lived as a hostage at the court of Constantinople for many years and learned a great deal about Roman government and military tactics, which served him well when he became the Gothic ruler of a mixed but largely Romanized 'barbarian people'.Charles the Great or Charles I, was the King of the Franks from 768, the King of Italy from 774, and from 800 the first emperor in western Europe since the collapse of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state he founded is called the Carolingian Empire. Charlemagne is considered to be the greatest ruler of the Carolingian Dynasty because of the achievements he made at what seemed like the very middle of the Dark Ages.Military CampaignWhen Charlemagne was 26, he along with his brother Carloman, inherited the kingdom of the Franks. Charlemagne was determined to improve education and religion and to bring Europe out of turmoil. To do this, he launched a 30-year military campaign in 772-804 of conquests, which united Europe and spread Christianity.The first step that Charlemagne took in building his empire was to conquer new territories. The first of these conquering campaigns was against the Lombards, he came out victorious and won the Lombard lands to the north of Italy. Charlemagne also led a victorious campaign against the Saxons of the east. Besides this, he expanded his empire towards southern Germany, southern France, and the island of Corsica. He fought the Avars, adding modern-day Hungary, and also fought against the moors of Spain, gaining the northern part of Spain. Through these conquests, Charlemagne united Europe and spread Christianity.[Figure 2]Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic who maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life. In 772, when Pope Adrian I was threatened by invaders, the king rushed to Rome to provide assistance. Shown here, the pope asks Charlemagne for help at a meeting near Rome. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons, CC0.Many view Charlemagne as the person who helped reunite Western Europe (and it was hoped all of Europe by some) in the spirit of the old Roman Empire. However, that did not actually happen. The progress made by Charlemagne has been celebrated by Europeans though. The Charlemagne Prize has been awarded once a year since 1950 by the German city of Aachen to people who have contributed to the ideals upon which it has been founded. It commemorates Charlemagne, ruler of the Frankish Empire and founder of what became the Holy Roman Empire, who resided and is buried at Aachen. Today it is given annually to a person who has helped promote European Unity.BeliefsCharlemagne had very different beliefs from past rulers. He believed that government should be for the benefit of the governed, and he backed up those beliefs in what he accomplished for the people. He consistently tried to improve the lives of his people. He believed in the education of skills and religion. He felt it was important for everyone to have the same educational and religious training as the entire kingdom.Charlemagne was also successful in encouraging learning; he opened schools for the nobles and ordered monasteries to open schools. He was crowned Roman emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800.The church had converted many Germanic peoples. These new converts had settled in Rome's former lands. To adapt to rural conditions, the Church built religious communities. In monasteries, monks (Christian men) gave up their private possessions and devoted their lives to serving God. Monasteries also became Europe's best-educated communities. Monks opened schools, maintained libraries, and copied books.Decline of the EmpireAs Charlemagne grew older, he continued to give to the church and promote education, and he made laws that were in favor of spreading the Christian faith and supporting Christian morals and ethics. It was beginning to look like Western Europe was going to recover from the fall of Rome, but Charlemagne fell sick in 814 and died. His empire was split among his three sons, who eventually engaged in civil war, splitting their empires into small,feudal states.What is feudalism?Let's imagine that you're a poor European farmer in the Middle Ages. Here's the political situation: you don't own the land you live on. It's rented from a baron or a duke. You and your neighbors share a plow between you, and you combine your oxen into teams to till the soil together. There's not much social mobility: your parents and grandparents before you worked this same land. You don't even have the legal right to leave the property without the permission of your landlord. You're a serf in a feudal economy.Seventeenth-century historians and lawyers who studied the Middle Ages decided to give a common name to the diverse landowner-tenant arrangements that existed in northwest Europe during the Middle Ages, starting with the collapse of Charlemagne's empire in the late ninth century and declining after the Black Plague and the Peasant Revolt in the14thcentury. Though these arrangements could range widely in style, they were lumped together under the label of feudalism, from the Medieval Latin termfeudumreferring to a landed estate. Medieval economies were largely based around the operations of those landed estates. Modern historians dispute whether or not it's useful to lump together the management of these estates in that way. Rather than diving into the arguments of how to organize this history, let's discuss some common threads about those estates. For our purposes, the important thing is that those lands were cultivated with a combination of free and unfree labor.Why Serfdom?Without the peace guaranteed by Charlemagne's unified rule, the serfs needed a lord's protection In the absence of a strong centralized government, the threat of violence lurked everywhere: from bandits and the armed bands of other warlords. In exchange for tending a lord's demesne, a serf could expect the lord's private army to protect them. The lords needed the serfs too. Labor shortages caused by war and disease limited the available workforce in Western Europe. This is part of why the terms of serfdom constrained a peasant's rights to resettle - it maintained a labor pool for the lordly class. While the term of these agreements could vary widely, as they were derived from a variety of sources ""barbarian"" codes of the Germanic kingdoms, Church law, and Roman property ordinances, some labor practices were relatively standard.The unfree farming that elite landlords oversaw sustained the military units that protected their estates, and the people who worked and lived on them. The wealth generated by these feudal estates powered the Crusades, and, following the Black Death and the Peasant Revolt, would begin to concentrate in the peasant class. This would lead to artisan specialization, the growth of cities, and a desire for goods from far-off places. Those factors together would lead to the rise of guild economies, the Renaissance, and the colonial voyages of discovery.Slavery and SerfdomThere are important distinctions between slavery and serfdom. Slavery describes a system in which a person can be bought and sold as property whereas enslaved people were not considered human beings with rights. Take a look at a translation of this early medieval law from Bavaria, a region now part of Germany: ""A sale once completed should not be altered, unless a defect is found which the vendor has concealed, in the slave or horse or any other livestock sold...for animals have defects which a vendor can sometimes conceal."" Classifying enslaved people as livestock was typical at the time this law was written; enslaved people were not deemed to be people. Serfs, however, were legally people though they had far fewer rights than free peasants (poor farmers of low social status). Serfs' movement were constrained, their property rights were limited, and they owed rents of all sorts to their landlords.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.VikingsVikings were Norse seafarers who originated in Scandinavia and raided, traded, explored, and settled in wide areas of Europe, Asia, and the North Atlantic islands. The period from the earliest recorded raids in the 790s until theNormanconquest of England in 1066 is commonly known as the Viking Age of Scandinavian history. Vikings used the Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea for sea routes to the south.Viking shipsThere have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built according to their intended uses, though the most iconic type is probably thelongship. Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and they were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. It was the longship, that allowed the Norse to go Viking (on an expedition), which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings. Longships were the epitome of Scandinavian naval power at the time, and were highly valued possessions.[Figure 3]Model of the Gokstad ship. The Gokstad ship is a Viking ship found in a burial mound at Gokstad farm in Sandar, Sandefjord, Vestfold, Norway. Dendrochronological dating suggests that the ship was built around 890 AD.Ships were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighboring cultures. They also held a major religious importance; magnates and people with a high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items.Weapons and WarfareWeapons were indicative of a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking would have a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail shirt, and sword. A typical bóndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less 'honorable' than a weapon, which could be used in close combat. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon.In combat the Vikings are believed to have engaged in a disordered style of frenetic, furious fighting, although the brutal perception of the vikings is largely a misconception, likely attributed to Christian misunderstandings at the time regarding paganism.TradeThe Vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia.The Viking world was unfamiliar with the use of coinage and instead silver was the most common metal in the economy by large, although gold was also used to some extent. Silver circulated in the form of bars,ingots,as well as in the form of jewelry and ornaments. Traders carried small scales, enabling them to measure weight very accurately, so it was possible to have a very precise system of trade and exchange, even without a regular coinage.The organized trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products. Imported goods included silk, spices and wine, whilst exported goods comprised of wool, fur, amber, weapons, salt and wax.Viking ExpansionThe Vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the North Atlantic, ventured south to North Africa and east to Russia, Constantinople, and the Middle East. They raided and pillaged, but also engaged in trade, settled wide-ranging colonies, and acted as mercenaries.The Vikings did not expand or conquer much into mainland Europe. Their realm was bordered by powerful cultures to the south. The Saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the Vikings. Vikings soon witnessed the violent subduing of the Saxons by Charlemagne,in the 30-year campaigns of the Saxon Wars resulting in the spread of forced Christianity.The south coast of the Baltic Sea was ruled by the Obotrites,a federation of Slavic tribes. The Vikings destroyed the Obortrite city of Reric in 808 CE, which would remain throughout the Viking Age.From Rome to ByzantiumThe fall of the Roman Empire is a pivotal moment in world history. But we sometimes forget that part of the Roman Empire continued on. Even though the Western Roman Empire, which was centered around Rome, collapsed, the Eastern Roman Empire survived in the form of theByzantine Empire.The Byzantine Empire lasted for a millennium after the fall of the Roman Empire, ending with the Ottoman conquests in 1453.The Byzantine Empire's capital city was Constantinople, which is also called Byzantium and Istanbul. The capital was well- positioned near active trade routes connecting east and west. Constantinople was named after Emperor Constantine I, the first Byzantine emperor. Constantine who ruled from 324 to 327 CE was also an important figure in Roman history, and that's because the histories of the two empires are linked. The Roman Empire in the east transformed into Byzantine Empire over time, there is a lot of historical overlap. Constantine was notable because he made some significant changes to the Roman Empire, transforming it into Byzantine Empire. these changes eventually created a distinct Byzantine culture which set the new empire apart from its Roman past.Even so, people living under the Byzantine Empire continued to see themselves as Romans and continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire; both Byzantine Empire and Eastern Roman Empire are terms created much later. Many Byzantine leaders, like Emperor Constantine, built upon Roman culture and saw themselves as part of its legacy.Despite the overlap, there are some important differences between the two empires, differences more substantial than simply having separate capital cities. People living in the Byzantine Empire had a unique heritage based on Greek culture and Orthodox Christianity. Christianity was integrated into daily life, although there were also significant pagan Roman influences. The Byzantine empire was also the first empire to be founded not just on military and economic power, but on the authority of the Christian Church. This was largely Constantine's legacy. He was the first Christian emperor of the Roman Empire, and he legalized Christianity. Later, under Theodosius I Christianity became the official state religion of the Byzantine Empire.The Early ByzantineStateIn many ways, the state functions of the Byzantine Empire were continuations of late Roman policies. Constantine maintained and built upon the structures created by the Roman Emperor Diocletian who ruled from 224 to 312 CE. Diocletian had introduced a standardized system of taxation, which divided the empire into roughly one hundred provinces, each of which was managed by civil officer.This provincial system lasted for a few centuries into the Byzantine Empire. Under this late Roman system, groups of provinces were organized into dioceses, each of which was administered by a vicar. Dioceses were grouped into large administrative areas called praetorian prefectures, which were administered by officials called prefects. At the level of the prefecture, prefects managed public taxes, the justice system, the public post, weapons and arms manufacturing, and public works. Each prefect reported to one of the four emperors of tetrarchy, which was a system instituted by Diocletian whereby power was divided between four emperors. Under the tetrarchy, the empire was divided into an eastern and western area.Constantine maintained this system in many ways. However, he replaced Diocletian's tetrarchy with dynastic succession, making himself the sole emperor. He did this by defeating a rival emperor and unifying the empire into one. Constantine also reorganized and unifying the empire into one. Constantine also reorganized the government and the economy.At the level of the prefecture, prefects managed public taxes, the justice system, the public post, weapons and arms manufacturing, and public works.Each prefect reported to one of the four emperors of the tetrarchy, which was a system instituted by Diocletian whereby power was divided between four emperors. Under the tetrarchy, the empire was divided into an eastern and western area.Another difference between the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Empire was the new Christian character of the Byzantine state. While Diocletian promoted the deities Jupiter and Hercules, Constantine endorsed monotheism and oversaw the crystallization of early Christian doctrine. Constantine and his successors saw themselves as responsible for the welfare of all Christians, including those outside the boundaries of the Byzantine Empire.Emperor Justinian I also build upon Roman ideas when he put forth a unified Roman legal code. Prior to his reign Roman laws had differed from region to region and many contradicted one another. Justinian's newly unified code not only served as the basis for law in the Byzantine Empire, but it was the main influence on the Catholic Church's development ofcanon law.Justinian's laws went on to become the basis of law in many European countries as well.Justinian also recaptured territories in the west which had been lost by his predecessors. It was during Justinian's reign that many of the most notable buildings and works of art in the Byzantine Empire were completed. In Constantinople, the Hagia Sophia was constructed under Justinian's orders. At the time, it was the largest church in the world. Justinian also contributed to Constantinople's growth by creating trade routes linking the capital to major cities to the east and west.Constantine unified the eastern and western halves of the empire, but Justinian was also responsible for an important reunification. The Latin-speaking western region had been moving away, culturally, religiously, and politically, from its eastern counterpart prior to Justinian's rule. Justinian attempted to bridge this divide by reconquering territory in Italy and north Africa, including Rome. He also took a stand on Christian interpretations that were deemed heretical, particularly those found to be heretical by the church in Rome. To finance his military campaigns and building projects, Justinian reformed the tax system. This decision was unpopular and led to many riots, which Justinian was mostly successful in subduing. However, the tax base was greatly reduced after plague decimated the population.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Video AssignmentTen Minute History - Charlemagne and the Carolingian EmpireWhy was Charlemagne's reign significant?How far did Charlemagne's region stretch?Who did Charlemagne share power with?

16,3.3,The Medieval Church in the West,"[Figure 1]Image by Peter, courtesy of Flickr, licensed under CC BY 2.0.Student Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able toExplain the development of Christianity as a unifying social and political factor in medieval Europe and the Byzantine Empire. [WHS.4A]Explain the characteristics of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. [WHS.4B]Identify significant examples of art and architecture that demonstrate an artistic ideal or visual principle from selected cultures. [WHS.26A]Medieval Europe and the Byzantine EmpireThe Medieval ChurchChristianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africasunderedmaritime connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the western Church. The eastern church used Greek instead of the western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle eighth century, issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities. The formal break came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two churches—the western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the eastern branch the Orthodox Church.Early Middle AgesThe Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, calledcenobitism, which was pioneered by Pachomius (d. 348) in the fourth century.Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the sixth century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by anabbot. Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centers of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, and bases for missions and conversion. They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as Bede (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late seventh and early eighth centuries.So much of what the average person knows, or thinks they know, about the Middle Ages comes from film and tv. The word ""medieval"" calls to mindMonty Python and the Holy Grail, ""Blackadder,""The Sword in the Stone, lusty wenches, feasting, courtly love, the plague, jousting, and chain mail. Perhaps someone who had seen (or better yet read)The Name of the RoseorPillars of the Earthwould add cathedrals, manuscripts, monasteries, feudalism, monks and friars. Petrarch, an Italian poet and scholar of the fourteenth century, famously referred to the period of time between the fall of the Roman Empire (c. 476) and his own day (c. 1330s) as the Dark Ages. Petrarch believed that the Dark Ages was a period of intellectual darkness due to the loss of the classical learning, which he saw as light. Later historians picked up on this idea and ultimately the term Dark Ages was transformed into Middle Ages. Broadly speaking, the Middle Ages is the period of time in Europe between the end of antiquity in the fifth century and the Renaissance, or rebirth of classical learning, in the15thand16thcenturies.Not So Dark After AllCharacterizing the Middle Ages as a period of darkness falling between two greater, more intellectually significant periods in history is misleading. The Middle Ages was not a time of ignorance and backwardness, but rather a period during which Christianity flourished in Europe. Christianity, and specifically Catholicism in the Latin West, brought with it new views of life and the world that rejected the traditions and learning of the ancient world. During this time, the Roman Empire slowly fragmented into many smaller political entities. The geographical boundaries for European countries today were established during the Middle Ages. This was a period that heralded the formation and rise of universities, the establishment of the rule of law, numerous periods of ecclesiastical reform and the birth of the tourism industry. Many works of medieval literature, such as theCanterbury Tales, theDivine Comedy, andThe Song of Roland, are widely read and studied today. The visual arts prospered during the Middle Ages, which created its own aesthetic values. The wealthiest and most influential members of society commissioned cathedrals, churches, sculpture, painting, textiles, manuscripts, jewelry, and ritual items from artists. Many of these commissions were religious in nature, but medieval artists also produced secular art. Few names of artists survive and fewer documents record their business dealings, but they left behind an impressive legacy of art and culture.The Church and the StateSo, if we go back to the year 1500, the Church (what we now call the Roman Catholic Church) was very powerful (politically and spiritually) in Western Europe (and in fact ruled over significant territory in Italy called the Papal States). But there were other political forces at work too. There was the Holy Roman Empire (largely made up of German speaking regions ruled by princes, dukes and electors), the Italian city-states, England, as well as the increasingly unified nation states of France and Spain (among others). The power of the rulers of these areas had increased in the previous century and many were anxious to take the opportunity offered by the Reformation to weaken the power of the papacy (the office of the Pope) and increase their own power in relation to the Church in Rome and other rulers.Keep in mind too, that for some time the Church had been seen as an institution plagued by internal power struggles (at one point in the late 1300s and 1400s, church was ruled by three Popes simultaneously).Popesand Cardinals often lived more like kings than spiritual leaders. Popes claimed temporal (political) as well as spiritual power. They commanded armies, made political alliances and enemies, and, sometimes, even waged war. Simony (the selling of Church offices) and nepotism (favoritism based on family relationships) were rampant. Clearly, if the Pope was concentrating on these worldly issues, there wasn't as much time left for caring for the souls of the faithful. The corruption of the Church was well known, and several attempts had been made to reform the Church (notably by John Wyclif and Jan Hus), but none of these efforts successfully challenged Church practice until Martin Luther's actions in the early 1500s.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Gothic architectureis a style of architecture that flourished during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period asOpus Francigenum(""French work"") with the termGothicfirst appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe.

A great number of ecclesiastical buildings remain from this period, of which even the smallest are often structures of architectural distinction while many of the larger churches are considered priceless works of art and are listed with UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. For this reason a study of Gothic architecture is largely a study of cathedrals and churches.Monastic Reform[Figure 3]Monastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established as part of the Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigor. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.Monastic reform inspired change in the secular church. The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049-1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073-1085) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony.The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.High Middle AgesThe High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the Carthusians and the Cistercians. The latter especially expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the Laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who along with those wishing to enter the religious life wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life. Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome, Jerusalem, and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors, and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence.The Scholastic MovementThe new Christian method of learning was influenced by Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) from the rediscovery of the works of Aristotle, at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and Muslim Philosophy (Maimonides, Avicenna, and Averroes) and then through Aristotle's own works brought back from Byzantine and Muslim libraries; and those whom he influenced, most notably Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure and Abélard. Many scholastics believed in empiricism and supporting Roman Catholic doctrines through secular study, reason, and logic. They opposed Christian mysticism, and the Platonist-Augustinian belief that the mind is an immaterial substance. The most famous of the scholastics was Thomas Aquinas (later declared a ""Doctor of the Church""), who led the move away from the Platonic and Augustinian and towards the Aristotelianism. Aquinas developed a philosophy of mind by writing that the mind was at birth atabularasa(""blank slate"") that was given the ability to think and recognize forms or ideas through a divine spark. Other notable scholastics included Roselyn, Abélard, Peter Lombard, and Francisco Suárez. One of the main questions during this time was the problem of universals. Prominent opponents of various aspects of the scholastic mainstream included Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter Damian, Bernard of Clairvaux, and the Victorines.[Figure 4]""Apotheosis of St. Thomas Aquinas"" by Francisco de Zurbaran. Image courtesy of WikiArt.org, licensed under CC0.Thomas Aquinasalso known as Tommaso d'Aquino (1225-1274), was an Italian Dominican friar and Catholic priest who was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as ""Doctor Angelicus"" and ""Doctor Communis"". He is heralded as the most influential Western medieval legal scholar and theologist. ""Aquinas"" is from the county of Aquino, an area where his family held land until 1137. He was the foremost classical proponent of natural theology and the father of Thomas. His influence on Western thought is considerable, and much of modern philosophy was conceived in development or opposition of his ideas, particularly in the areas of ethics, natural law, metaphysics, and political theory. Unlike many currents in the church of the time, Thomas embraced several ideas put forward by Aristotle--whom he referred to as ""the Philosopher""--and attempted to synthesize Aristotelian philosophy with the principles of Christianity. The works for which he is best known are theSumma Theologicaand theSumma Contra Gentiles.His contemporaries on Sacred Scripture and on Aristotle are an important part of his body of work. Furthermore, Thomas is distinguished for this eucharistic hymns, which form part of the Church's liturgy.Late Byzantine (c.1261 - 1453)Between 1204 and 1261, the Byzantine Empire suffered another crisis: the Latin Occupation. Crusaders from Western Europe invaded and captured Constantinople in 1204, temporarily toppling the empire in an attempt to bring the eastern empire back into the fold of western Christendom. (By this point Christianity had divided into two distinct camps: eastern [Orthodox] Christianity in the Byzantine Empire and western [Latin] Christianity in the European west.)By 1261 the Byzantine Empire was free of its western occupiers and stood as an independent empire once again, albeit markedly weakened. The breadth of the empire had shrunk, and so had its power. Nevertheless Byzantium survived until the Ottomans took Constantinople in 1453. In spite of this period of diminished wealth and stability, the arts continued to flourish in the Late Byzantine period, much as it had before.Although Constantinople fell to the Turks in 1453 - bringing about the end of the Byzantine Empire - Byzantine art and culture continued to live on in its far-reaching outposts, as well as in Greece, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire, where it had flourished for so long.The Russian Empire, which was first starting to emerge around the time Constantinople fell, carried on as the heart of Byzantium, with churches and icons created in a distinct ""Russo-Byzantine"" style (left). Similarly, in Italy, when the Renaissance was first emerging, it borrowed heavily from the traditions of Byzantium. Cimabue'sMadonna Enthronedof 1280-1290 is one of the earliest examples of the Renaissance interest in space and depth in panel painting. But the painting relies on Byzantine conventions and is altogether indebted to the arts of Byzantium.[Figure 5]So, while we can talk of the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, it is much more difficult to draw geographic or temporal boundaries around the empire, for it spread out to neighboring regions and persisted in artistic traditions long after its own demise.Khan Academy essay by Dr. Ellen HurstVideo AssignmentThe Dark Ages...How Dark Were They, Really?by Crash CourseWhat time period encompasses the Middle Ages?Why were they called the Dark Ages?What is feudalism?Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentCreate two sensory figures, one representing the Pope and one representing the Patriarch in Constantinople in 1054.

17,3.4,"Norman Invasion of England, Feudalism, Manorialism and the High Middle Ages","[Figure 1]Student Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able toIdentify the major causes and describe the development of feudalism and manorial economic systems as important turning points in world history from 600 to 1450. [WHS.1C]Describe the major characteristics of and the factors contributing to the development of the political/social system of feudalism and the economic system of manorialism. [WHS.4C]Identify significant examples of art and architecture that demonstrate an artistic ideal or visual principle from selected cultures. [WHS.26A]Feudalism, Manorialism and the High Middle AgesTheNormanconquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, laterWilliam the Conqueror.William's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor, who may have encouraged William's hopes for the throne. Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig and the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and joined forces with Tostig; together they defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. Five days later on 25 September 1066, they were defeated and killed by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.Battle of HastingsThe deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering from Stamford, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.[Figure 2]Site of the Battle of HastingsHarold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings. The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown; estimates are around 10,000 for William and about 7,000 for Harold. The composition of the forces is clearer; the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect; therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers.Rebellions to William's ruleThe lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William gave lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, the introduction of Norman French as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.Bayeux TapestryThe Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered cloth, nearly 70 meters (230 ft) long, which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England concerning William, Duke of Normandy, and Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings.In a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064–1066 with the two main protagonists Harold II and William the Conqueror. The identity of Harold II of England in the panel depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians disagree with the traditional view that Harold II is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow.[Figure 3]The tapestry depicts the loss of the Anglo-Saxon troops to the Norman forces. Here, a figure some think to be Harold Godwinson is shown falling at the Battle of Hastings. Harold is shown with an arrow to the eye.FeudalismFeudalism was a set of legal and military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries and can be broadly defined as a system for structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour.Feudalism as practiced in England was a state of human society which was formally structured and stratified on the basis of land tenure. Society was ordered around relationships derived from the holding of land known as fiefdoms or fiefs.Structure of the Feudal State in EnglandThere were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. It is important to note that the King was the absolute 'owner' of land in thefeudal systemand all nobles, knights and other tenants, termed vassals, merely 'held' land from the king, who was thus at the top of the feudal pyramid.Below the king in the feudal pyramid was a tenant-in-chief (generally in the form of a baron or knight) who was a vassal of the king. Holding from the tenant-in-chief was amesne tenant-- generally a knight, sometimes a baron, or a tenant-in-chief in their capacity as holders of other fiefs. Below the mesne tenant further mesne tenants could hold from each other in series. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.VassalageBefore a lord could grant land (a fief) to a tenant, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony. The ceremony was called a commendation ceremony, and was composed of the two-part act ofhomageand oath offealty(allegiance). During homage, the lord and vassal entered a contract in which the vassal agreed to provide military support and protection and promised to fight for the lord at his command. In exchange, the lord typically granted privileges such as land, which was held as a fiefdom and agreed to protect the vassal from external forces, a valuable right in a society without police and with only a rudimentary justice system.[Figure 4]Roland (right) receives the sword, Durandal, from the hands of Charlemagne (left). From a manuscript of a chanson de gets, c.14th Century.The authority of a lord was final. In this scene from""A Knights Tale,""the prince of England, Edward, formally christens the serf  William and dubs him a knight. Notice how quickly the serfs change their tone once the prince appears. It seems the peasants were taught not to  question the authority of the nobles.Some historians argue against the concept of feudalism entirely. What can be said for sure is that it was a much more rural society where smaller kingdoms tried to create order from a world devoid of the Roman imperial tradition that had preceded it. Two strong forces held sway - royalty and the Catholic Church. As the Roman Empire split and the church followed, Western Europe was more rural, decentralized, and without consistent imperial rule. The church was the most powerful aspect of most people's lives. This fragmented and decentralized Western Europe leads to a highly competitivecity-statemodel that propels Europe forward after the year 1000. At first this was a slow and gradual process that picked up speed and led to a new blended civilization in Western Europe. Byzantium, on the other hand, slowly declined as Western Europe competitively used innovation and new technologies to gain power.ManorialismManorialism was an essential element of feudal society and was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the villa system of the Late Roman Empire. Manorialism was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe, and was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms ofagrariancontract.Manorialism was characterized by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor. The Lord was supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called afief), and from the obligatory contributions of the peasant population who feel under the jurisdiction of the Lord and his court. These obligations could be payable in several ways, in labor, in kind, or, on rare occasions, in coin.SerfdomSerfdom was the status of peasants under feudalism, specifically relating to manorialism. It was a condition of bondage which developed primarily during the Middle Ages in Europe.Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the Lord of the Manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society and the Lord of the Manor and his serfs were bound legally, economically, and socially. Serfs formed the lowest social class of feudal society.VilleinsA villein (or villain) was the most common type of serf in the Middle Ages. Villeins had more rights and higher status than the lowest serf, but existed under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them fromfreemen. Villeins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with the landlord, the lord of the manor, they were expected to spend some of their time working on the lord's fields. The requirement often was not greatly onerous, contrary to popular belief, and was often only seasonal, for example the duty to help at harvest-time. The rest of their time was spent farming their own land for their own profit.Like other types of serfs, they were required to provide other services, possibly in addition to paying rent of money or produce. Villeins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord's consent and the acceptance of the lord to whose manor they proposed to migrate to. Villeins were generally able to hold their own property, unlike slaves.Villeinage was not a purely uni-directional exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land within a lord's manor provided sustenance and survival, and being a villein guaranteed access to land, and crops secure from theft bymaraudingrobbers. Landlords, even where legally entitled to do so, rarelyevictedvilleins because of the value of their labour. Villeinage was much preferable to being avagabond, a slave, or an unlanded laborer.In many medieval countries, a villein could gain freedom by escaping from a manor to a city or borough and living there for more than a year; but this action involved the loss of land rights and agricultural livelihood, a prohibitive price unless the landlord was especially tyrannical or conditions in the village were unusually difficult.The Manor SystemManors each consisted of up to three classes of land:Demesne, the part directly controlled by the lord and used for the  benefit of his household and dependents;Dependent (serf or villein) holdings carrying the obligation that the peasant household supply the lord with specified labour services or a part of its output;Free peasant land, without such obligation but otherwise subject to manorial jurisdiction and custom, and owing money rent fixed at the time of the lease.Additional sources of income for the lord included charges for use of his mill, bakery or wine-press, or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland, as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses, perhaps a reason why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure.Video AssignmentWho was William the Conqueror?What year was and what was the significance of the Battle of Hastings?What is the most famous document of William's time?For what amount of time were men required to serve in the military?Interactive Student Notebook assignmentsResearch thecharacteristics ofa feudal system versus a manorial system.

[]WHS.1C]Muhammad and the Faith of Islam[Figure 2]This verse from the Qur'an, originally written in Arabic, translates ""Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"" (Qur'an 48:29). Image courtesy of ushistory.org, licensed under CC by 3.0.The Messenger of Allah courtesy Muslim Students Association, University of Southern California This verse from the Qur'an, originally written in Arabic, translates ""Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"" (Qur'an 48:29)A man meditating alone in a cave near Mecca received a religious vision. This vision laid the foundations for a new religion. The year was 610 and the man's name was Muhammad. The belief system that arose from Muhammad's ideas became the basis of one of the world's most widely practiced religions:Islam.Muhammadwas born around 570 in the city of Mecca, located on the Arabian Peninsula. Both of his parents died before Muhammad was six and he was raised by his grandfather and uncle. His family belonged to a poor clan that was active in Mecca politics.Following the traditions of wealthy families, he spent part of his childhood living with a Bedouin family.Bedouinsled fairly isolated lives as nomadic herders in the harsh Arabian desert. Muhammad's experiences among these people most likely had a strong influence on the development of Islam.In his twenties, Muhammad began working as a merchant and soon married his employer, a rich woman named Khadijah. Over the next 20 years, he became a wealthy and respected trader traveling throughout the Middle East. He and his wife had six children — two boys (who did not live into adulthood) and four girls. By the time he was 40, he began having religious visions that would change his life.A Revelation of FaithWhile meditating in a cave on Mount Hira, Muhammad had a revelation. He came to believe that he was called on by God to be a prophet and teacher of a new faith, Islam, which means literally ""submission."" This new faith incorporated aspects of Judaism and Christianity. It respected the holy books of these religions and its great leaders and prophets — Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others. Muhammad called Abraham ""Khalil"" (""God's friend"") and identified him as Islam's ancient patriarch. Islam traces its heritage through Abraham's son Ishmael. Muhammad believed that he himself was God's final prophet.The 5 Pillars of IslamCentral to Islamic beliefs are theFive Pillars of Faith, which all followers of Islam — called Muslims — must follow:There is only one universal god: Allah.Followers of Islam (Muslims) are expected to pray five times each day while facing Mecca.All Muslims are expected to pay a yearly tax that is mostly intended to help the poor and needy.For the entire month of Ramadan, Muslims must not eat, smoke, drink, or have sexual relations from sunrise to sunset.All able Muslims must make a pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca at least once in their lifetimes.Prayer and Pilgrimage[Figure 4]Pilgrimage to a holy site is a core principle of almost all faiths. The Kaaba, meaning cube in Arabic, is a square building elegantly draped in a silk and cotton veil. Located in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, it is the holiest shrine in Islam.In Islam, Muslims pray five times a day and after 624 CE, these prayers were directed towards Mecca and the Kaaba rather than Jerusalem; this direction—or qibla in Arabic—is marked in all mosques and enables the faithful to know in which direction they should pray. The Qur‘an established the direction of prayer.All Muslims aspire to undertake the hajj, or the annual pilgrimage, to the Kaaba once in their lives if they are able. Prayer five times a day and the hajj are two of the five pillars of Islam, the most fundamental principles of the faith.Upon arriving in Mecca, pilgrims gather in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram around the Kaaba. They then circumambulate—tawaf in Arabic—or walk around the Kaaba, during which they hope to kiss and touch the Black Stone—al-Hajar al-Aswad—embedded in the eastern corner of the Kaaba.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Khan Academy by Dr. Elizabeth Macaulay- LewisFrom Mecca to Medina and BackMecca houses Islam's holiest site, the Kaaba, which was believed to have been built for Yahweh by Abraham and his son Ishmael. Islam spread at almost Internet-like speed, encompassing much of the former territories of the ancient Near East, North Africa, and Spain. Muhammad's message was especially well received by the poor and slaves. But many people were opposed to his message. This opposition only seemed to make him more determined. After years of publicly promoting his ideas, he became so disliked that some began plotting his murder.In 622, fearing for his life, Muhammad fled to the town of Medina. This flight from Mecca to Medina became known as the Hegira, Arabic for ""flight."" The Muslim calendar begins on this year. In Medina, the local people welcomed Muhammad and his followers. There, Muhammad built the first mosque, or Islamic temple, and began to work to separate Islam from Judaism and Christianity, which had originally influenced him.Whereas his followers had originally prayed while facing toward Jerusalem, he now had them face toward Mecca. Muhammad continued to have revelations from Allah. The ideas from these revelations formed the basis of a poetic text called the Koran, which contains the fundamental ideas of Islam.Muhammad fought a number of battles against the people of Mecca. In 629, Muhammad returned to Mecca with an army of 1500 converts to Islam and entered the city unopposed and without bloodshed. Before his death two years later, he forcefully converted most of the Arabian Peninsula to his new faith and built a small empire.JihadBelief injihadis a common thread to many Islamic sects. Although the exact meaning is difficult to express in English,jihadis most accurately translated as ""struggle."" For most Muslims,jihadis a personal struggle against evil. The holy battles of this spiritual struggle are fought inside Muslims' minds and souls.Sometimes, the struggle can take the form of a physical war against non-believers. Although this kind of jihad is referred to in English as a ""holy war,"" most Muslims believe there is nothing holy about war and that wars should only be fought against oppressors and aggressors.A minority of Muslims, however, places great importance on holy war jihads. This minority feels that Muslims must wage war against all nonbelievers. It is this conception ofjihadthat inspires Islamic extremist terrorism. Unfortunately, due to media coverage, this is the interpretation ofjihadthat most Westernershave. It should be reiterated that mainstream Islam is peaceful and rejects the idea of unprovoked war. Although the concept ofjihadis widespread, it has not been accepted by the general Islamic community as one of the Pillars of Islam.Division with in Islamic CommunityUnfortunately, Muhammad had not designated a successor. The struggle over leadership that followed his death has divided Muslims to this day, creating a division in Islam between the Sunnis and Shiites.Despite these problems, a vast Islamic empire was created over the next 12 centuries that would build a base of worshipers unrivaled by any other religion.Life on the African Desert[Figure 5]Only around 20% of the Sahara looks like this stereotypical desert,the rest is rocky desert or has small amounts if brush. That 20% is still larger than a quarter of the entire United States.TraditionalBedouinare pastoral nomads, or wanderers who travel with herds of domesticated animals. They are constantly on the move, with no permanent camping place. Their staple belongings include camels and tents, and they frown upon agriculture and all types of trades and crafts. Any type of settled life is traditionally considered beneath Bedouin dignity.While it may seem like the Bedouin lack order, this is far from true. Tribes are the basic unit of their social organization, and though simple, they are highly structured. For wandering purposes, tribes break into smaller clans and family units. Traveling and exploiting the land is much more efficient this way.Most of what is known about the Bedouin today involves Middle Eastern tribes and lands, but it is important to recognize that much of Bedouin history also took place in northern Africa. In fact, the Sahara was one of the first Bedouin territories.The early Bedouin left behind much more than a good story. They left the ideals of strength and endurance that have allowed their culture and peoples to survive today. Modern Bedouin tribes have been forced over the years to adapt to modern conditions. Gradually they have become more sedentary, but their foundation of pastoral nomadism is still firm and the desert is still the place they call home.Video AssignmentIslam, the Qur'an, and the Five Pillars All Without a FlamewarBy Crash CourseVideo Discussion QuestionsWhat three religious are tied to Arabia?What two empires surrounded Arabia?

During this time,he becamea religious, political and even military leader rather than a merchant (Khadija died in 619). Unfortunately, he did not address the issue of heir to his throne.  However, he ended the succession of prophets with the “seal of prophets.” What then would the future rulers of the region rule? Would there still be a theocracy?  The answer to these questions caused the biggest split in how Islam and the regions it dominates are practiced today.[Figure 2]Muhammad and the Caliphate: From 632-656There was no clear successor to Muhammad among his followers. The likely candidates included Abu Bakr (the father of Muhammad's wife A'isha) and Ali (a cousin of Muhammad and the husband of Muhammad's daughter Fatima). Abu Bakr is elected, and takes the title 'khalifat rasul-Allah'.The Arabic phrase means 'successor of the Messenger of God'. It introduced a new word, caliph, to the other languages of the world.Abu Bakr, the firstcaliph, lived no more than two years after the death of Muhammad. Even so, within this brief time, Muslim armies began their astonishing expansion, subduing the whole of Arabia and striking as far north as Palestine.Omar (another father-in-law of Muhammad) succeeded Abu Bakr in 634, who in 638 captured Jerusalem. Six years later, Omar was stabbed and killed in the mosque at Medina for personal reasons, it seems, by a Persian craftsman living in Kufa. Othman, chosen as the third caliph, was a son-in-law of Muhammad. By the end of his reign, in 656, Arabs conquered as far afield as north Africa, Turkey, and Afghanistan.Othman, like his predecessor, was assassinated, but this time by rebellious Muslims. They chose Ali, another son-in-law of Muhammad, as the fourth caliph. For the first time within the Muslim community, the selected caliph was the choice of just one faction. Ali's caliphate eventually provoked the only major sectarian split in the history of Islam betweenSunni and Shi'a.Sunni and ShiaEarly Period (c. 640-900 CE)After Muhammad’s death in 634, there were four caliphs later referred to by the Sunni as ""rightfully guided"" who succeeded Muhammad. However, from 656 there were conflicts over succession, and two civil wars (656-661 and 680-692) broke out within the community of Muslims. Out of these wars emerged the Umayyad Dynasty, whose capital was Damascus in modern-day Syria. Responsible for the first great monuments of Islamic art and architecture, Umayyad rulers built the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Great Mosque of Damascus, and the so-called Desert Palaces in Syro-Palestine. The Umayyads ruled as caliphs until 750 CE when they were overthrown by the Abbasids. The Abbasids, like the Umayyads before them, ruled as caliphs over much of the Islamic world until 861. Their capital was at Baghdad, and later they ruled from the palace-city of Samarra in Iraq for parts of the ninth century. After 861, the Abbasids lost control of large parts of their empire through a series of uprisings in which provincial governors asserted their independence. A series of local dynasties, such as the Aghlabids (800-909) and Tulunids (868-905) in North Africa, and the Buyids (945-1055) in Central Asia, emerged and ruled, developing regional artistic styles.Later Period (c. 1517 –1924 CE)This period is the era of the last great Islamic Empires. The Ottoman Empire, which had started as a small Turkic state in Anatolia in the early fourteenth century, emerged in the second half of the fifteenth century as a major military and political force. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453 and the Mamluk Empire in 1517. They dominated much of Anatolia, the Balkans, the Near East and North Africa until the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. The Ottomans are famous for their domed architecture and pencil minarets, many of which were built by the great architect, Sinan (1539-88) for Sultan Süleyman (r. 1520–66). This period is considered the peak of Ottoman art and culture.The Safavids, who established Shia Islam as the dominant faith of Iran, ruled from 1501–1722 and were the greatest dynasty to emerge from Iran. Architecture, paintings, manuscripts and carpets all flourished under the Safavids. Shah ‘Abbas (r. 1587–1629) was the greatest patron of the arts and the Safavid Dynasty’s most outstanding ruler. In the eighteenth century, a period of turmoil in Persia, the Qajar dynasty  (1779–1924) rose to power and established peace and their rule saw the beginning of modernity in Iran.by Dr. Elizabeth Macaulay-LewisAll Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.[Figure 3]Ali: 656-661Raised to the position of caliph by rebels, Ali spent most of his reign in conflict with other Muslims. He won the first battle, near Basra in 656, against an army fighting in support of Muhammad's widow, A'isha. She was herself in the fray, riding a camel, with the result that the event is remembered as the Battle of the Camel.But it was Ali's last success. The governor of Syria, Mu'awiya, waged a prolonged campaign against him to avenge the murder of the caliph Othman, his kinsman. Other opponents succeeded in assassinating Ali, in 661, outside the mosque in Kufa, a Muslim garrison town to which he has moved the capital from Medina.The Umayyad Caliphate:661-750Mu'awiya, the leader of the struggle against Ali and his supporters, established himself  as the undisputed caliphafter Ali's death in 661. His power basewasSyria. Damascus then became the capital of the first Muslim dynasty and the center of the new Arab empire.Mu'awiya was a member of one of the most prominent families of Mecca, the Umayyad. Against considerable opposition, he established a new principle: the role of caliph shall be hereditary rather than elected. For the next century and more, it is passed on within his family. The Umayyad dynasty would rule from Damascus until 750 and then established another kingdom at Cordoba, in Spain.The Shi'as: from the Seventh CenturyAfter the death of Ali, opponents of the new Umayyad dynasty promoted the claims of Ali's two sons, Hasan and Husayn (grandsons of Muhammad). Their party became known as Shi'at Ali (the 'party of Ali'). The political cause crumbled after the deaths of the brothers (Hasan dies in about 669 and Husayn, subsequently the most holy of Shi'ite martyrs, was killed in the battle of Karbala in 680). But their faction has from then on a lasting religious disagreement with the Islam of the caliphs.The main group under the caliphate became known as Sunni (those following Sunna, the orthodox rule) and the new schismatic sect acquired the name of Shi'as or Shi'ites, from the original name of their party.[Figure 4]Sufis: from the Eighth CenturyAs early as the eighth century, a reaction set in against the worldly interests resulting from the rapid rise of the caliphate to the status of a great temporal power. Devout Muslims struggled to retain the purity and mystical fervor of the early years of their religion. Insisting on a simple life, like the desert fathers of early Christianity, they were recognizable by their choice of plain woolen garments.The Arabic word for someone wearing wool issufi. This name became attached, in later centuries, to any Muslim inclined to the mysticismthathas always been part of Islam. There have been, and still are today, many different Sufi sects. They often begin as the followers of one particular holy man, and pilgrimage to the tomb of a saint has been an important part of Sufi devotion.Sufism is a form of religious experience and commitment open to any Muslim, without membership of a particular sect. In keeping with its name, it runs through Islam like a thread within a woolen garment.Arabs and Muslims: Eighth CenturyDuring the explosive first century of Arab expansion, the relationship subtly changed between two concepts - Arab and Muslim. At first they are inseparable. The Muslim armies were made up entirely of Arab tribesmen, and it was taken for granted that only Arabs can be Muslims. Between campaigns, the Arab armies stayed together in winter camps or garrison towns. They were an occupying force, having little link with the inhabitants of the conquered territories.But by the early eighth century, when the Muslim expansion had reached something approaching its peak, there were not enough Arabs to provide the troops. Out of necessity, people of other groups began to be received into Islam, fighting alongside the Arabs. Berbers did so in the west, and Persians in the east. Inevitably there were resentments. Non-Arabs often felt they were treated as second-class Muslims, particularly when it came to sharing out loot after a campaign. The conversion of outsiders to Islam brought a financial burden. Non-Muslims were charged a poll tax, which was not paid by believers. The spread of the faith is a drain on the treasury.These various tensions, and the inevitable difficulty of controlling the vast new empire, resulted in a rebellion in 747 against the Umayyad caliph.The Abbasid Caliphate: From 750Persia became the region in which resistance comes to a head against the caliphate of the Umayyads in Damascus. The uprising was partly a simple struggle between Arab factions, each of impeccable pedigree in relation to the pioneers of Islam. A revolt in Persia in 747 was headed by descendants of al-Abbas, an uncle of the prophet Muhammad. Their new caliphate, established in 750, would be known as Abbasid.The involvement of Persia was also significant. The Umayyad caliphate in Damascus derived from the early days of Islam when all Muslims are Arabs. But many Muslims in the east were then Persian, and Persian sophistication was beginning to divert Muslim culture from its simple Arab origins.Abbasid forces reached and captured Damascus in 750. Abul Abbas was proclaimed the first caliph of a new line. Male members of the Umayyad family are hunted down and killed (though one survived to establish a new Umayyad dynasty in Spain). The center of gravity of the Muslim world moved east, from Syria to Mesopotamia. In 762 a new capital city, Baghdad, was founded on the Tigris, about twenty miles upstream from Ctesiphon, one of the leading cities of the preceding Persian dynasty, the Sassanians.Baghdad: Eighth CenturyIn their new city of Baghdad, the Abbasid caliphs adopted the administrative system of the long-established Persian empire. Persian Muslims were as much involved in the life of this thriving place as Arab Muslims. Here Islam outgrew its Arab roots and becomes an international religion. Then from the 10th century, the Arabic and early Persian languages coalesced to become what is now known as Persian - combining words from both sources and using the Arabic script. Here Mesopotamia briefly recovered its ancient status at the center of one of the world's largest empires.At no time was this more evident than in the reign of the best-known of the Abbasid caliphs, Harun al-Rashid. The luxury and delight of Harun al-Rashid's Baghdad, in the late eighth century, hadimpressed on the western mind by one of the most famous works of Arabic literature,One Thousand and One Nights. Some of the stories are of a later date, but there are details in them that certainly relate to this period when for the first time a Muslim court had the leisure and prosperity to indulge in traditional oriental splendor.Islam and Other Religions: From the Seventh CenturyMuslims are instructed in the Qur'an to be tolerant of the two older and closely related religions, Judaism and Christianity, which share with Islam the essential characteristics of monotheism and a sacred book; they are all linked in the phrase 'people of the book'. Jews and Christians have therefore, through most of history, fared better under Islam than has been the fate of Jews or Muslims in Christian countries.Zoroastrianismisnot featured in the Qur'an, but it also has one god and a sacred book. The Muslim conquerors of Persia therefore show a degree of tolerance to the state religion of the previous dynasty.Arab Civilization: From the Eighth CenturyBy the end of the eighth century, a distinctive Arab civilizationemerged in widely separated regions: from the eighth century in Baghdad in the east and in Cordoba in the west. By the 10th century, between the two, there was a similar center in the new city of Cairo.The shared characteristics of these great cities were Islam, the Arabic language, and a tolerance that allows Christians and Jews to play a full part in the community. The results included an expansion of trade (making these places the most prosperous of their time, apart from T'ang China), and a level of scholarship and intellectual energy superior to contemporary Christian cities.Together with the spread of Islam, a lasting result of the events of the seventh century became the triumph of Arabic as a language in the Middle East and North Africa. In Palestine and Syria it gradually replaced Aramaic as the popular tongue; in Egypt it does the same with Coptic; further west along the North African coast, it edged the language of the Berbers into a minority status.The sense of identity of Arabs in subsequent centuries does not necessarily involve descent from the tribes of Arabia. It depends instead on the sharing of Arabic as both language and culture (implying also in most cases a commitment to Islam).Thisprovided the strong Arabic element in the civilization of the Middle Ages, from Mesopotamia to Spain.Video AssignmentIslam and PoliticsBy Crash Course World History 216Video Discussion QuestionsWhat does caliph mean?Who were the four ""rightly guided caliphs? discussed in the video?How are kings and caliphs similar?

Nok sculpture. Terracotta, 6th century BC–6th century CE, NigeriaThe Nok culture appeared in Nigeria around 1000 BCE and mysteriously vanished around 500 CE in the region of West Africa. This region lies in Central Nigeria. The culture’s social system is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok culture was considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta. It is suggested that the society eventually evolved into the later Yoruba Kingdom of Ife.According, to some accounts, based on artistic similarities to both early Yoruba art forms and Nok forms, there may be connections between them and the contemporary Yoruba people. Later brass and terracotta sculptures of the Ife and Benin cultures show significant similarities with those found at Nok. Iron use, in smelting and forging for tools, appears in Nok culture in Africa at least by 550 BCE and more probably in the middle of the second millennium BCE.Area of the Nok cultureBantu MigrationsThe Africans who will eventually dominate most of sub-Saharan Africa are tribes from the north speaking Bantu languages. The Bantu languages probably derive from the region of modern Nigeria and Cameroon. This western area, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, is also the cradle of other early developments in African history.  Iron smelting is known here, as in other sites in a strip below the Sahara, by the middle of the 1st millennium BC. And the fascinating but still mysterious Nok culture, lasting from the 5th century BC to the 2nd century AD, provides magnificent pottery figures which stand at the beginning of a recognizably African sculptural tradition.[Figure 4]Probably during the first millennium BCE, tribes speakingBantu languagesbegan to move south. They gradually pushed ahead of them the Khoisan, which eventually made the Bantu masters of nearly all the southern part of the continent.The Bantu expansion was a long series of physical migrations, a diffusion of language and knowledge out into and in from neighboring populations, and a creation of new societal groups involving inter-marriage among communities and small groups moving to communities and small groups moving to new areas.After their movements from their original homeland in West Africa, Bantus also encountered in East Africa peoples of Afro-Asiatic origin. As cattle terminology in use amongst the few modern Bantu pastoralist groups suggests, the Bantu migrants would acquire cattle from their new neighbors. Linguistic evidence also indicates that Bantus likely borrowed the custom of milking cattle.Kingdom of GhanaPenny Tweedie/Oxfam Traditions more than 1,000 years old still thrive in Ghana. Ghanaian boys are perfectly at home with traditional masks.Between the 9th and 11th centuries CE, the kingdom of Ghana was so rich that its dogs wore golden collars, and its horses, adorned with silken rope halters, slept on plush carpets. Based on animal luxuries alone, it is no wonder that foreigners touted Ghana's kings as the richest men in the world. Certainly they were living the high life, but how did they do it?Located within the present-day borders of Mauritania, Mali, and Senegal, medieval Ghana literally sat on a gold mine. The land's abundance of resources allowed Ghana's rulers to engage in years of prosperous trading. Strategic governing coupled with great location led to the rapid emergence of a very wealthy empire.Most of what we know about ancient Ghana — which is more accurately called Wagadugu — is based on writings of Arab travelers who came in contact with the nation's peoples. ""Ghana"" was actually the title given to Wagadugu kings and was used by the Islamic ""reporters"" to describe the rich and mysterious place they observed.Evidence of Ghana's occupation dates back to the fourth century, but it was several hundred years later that it became established as a nation by a tribe known as the Soninke, whose leaders have been credited with the early strengthening of the Wagadugu state and the expansion of its territories.By 1000 BCE, the nation had undergone strategic expansion and taken control of a large pocket of land between the upper Niger and Senegal Rivers. The region was rich in gold, and its acquisition meant that Ghana would become a leading force in the trans-Saharan trade network.Ghana PoliticsThe golden stool of the Ashanti kings of Ghana, a symbol of their power, has not been seen by the general public for 300 years. Its location is kept secret, and a replica is used for public display.The leader of all leaders was the king, who was also known as theghana, or war chief. His word was law. He served as the commander in chief of a highly organized army, the controller of all trade activities, and the head administrator of justice. Mayors, civil servants, counselors, and ministers were appointed by the king to assist with administrative duties — but at all times, the king was in charge.Each day, the king assembled his court and allowed people to publicly voice their complaints. Beating drums that resounded throughout the area signaled the courts assemblage and people gathered to speak their minds. Whether they were neighborly conflicts, or cases of violated rights, the king listened to the complaints and gave his judgment.Such hearings were reportedly peaceful, unless they involved issues of criminal nature. Two of the most serious criminal offenses were the denial of debt and the shedding of blood. These crimes were tried by ordeal.According to Islamic reports, the criminally accused was given a foul concoction to drink that consisted of sour and bitter-tasting wood and water. If he vomited after tossing back the nasty brew, he was declared innocent and was congratulated for passing the test. If he did not vomit, and the beverage remained within, he was considered guilty as charged and suffered the king's wrath.Ghanaian citizens were not the only ones put to the king's test. Inhabitants of its conquered lands were examined for their good behavior and loyalty as well. In territories where order and obedience prevailed and taxes were properly paid, autonomy was granted. But in areas which struggled for independence or defied the king's laws, Ghanaian governors were appointed as watchdogs and little went unreported to the king.Trans-Saharan TradeWhen the king was not busy enforcing his power among the people, he was spreading it internationally through trade. At its peak, Ghana was chiefly bartering gold, ivory, and slaves for salt from Arabs, and horses, cloth, swords, and books from North Africans and Europeans.This is a map of the ancient kingdom of Ghana, displaying its location well north of present-day Ghana. Today this area is part of the countries of Mali and Mauritania.Life on the Desert""There's no place like home."" To the Bedouin people, this ""home"" meant the entire Sahara desert. TraditionalBedouinare pastoral nomads, or wanderers who travel with herds of domesticated animals. They are constantly on the move, with no permanent camping place. Their staple belongings include camels and tents, and they frown upon agriculture and all types of trades and crafts. Any type of settled life is traditionally considered beneath Bedouin dignity.While it may seem like the Bedouin lack order, this is far from true. Tribes are the basic unit of their social organization, and though simple, they are highly structured. For wandering purposes, tribes break into smaller clans and family units. Traveling and exploiting the land is much more efficient this way.As salt was worth its weight in gold, and gold was so abundant in the kingdom, Ghana achieved much of its wealth through trade with the Arabs. Islamic merchants traveled over two months through the desert to reach Ghana and ""do business."" They were taxed for both what they brought in and what they took out. With this system, it is no wonder that Ghana got rich quickly. The wealth that the kingdom acquired did not, however, serve in its favor forever. Competition from other states in the gold trade eventually took its toll.Jealousy, fear, and anger of Ghana's power prompted its neighbors to stand up against the kingdom. Their efforts were at first weak and insignificant, but eventually, in the mid-11th century, a Muslim group known as the Almoravids launched a devastating invasion on the capital city of Koumbi Saleh. Though territories were seized, and a tribute tax was enforced, Ghana recovered and forced the invaders to withdraw.Islam Comes to Africa - ArabizationThe first Arab invasion of North Africa was led by ancestors of the Bedouin and occurred in 643 CE. At the time of the invasion, northern Africa already had a long history of foreign attack and cultural infusion. The Greeks, Romans, and Phoenicians had previously left their marks, and it was time for the Arab Muslims to do the same.[Figure 8]The traditional desert city is walled for defense, as the flat desert provides no natural barriers. Walls have gates, which are points of access to the city. Here you see the walls of Marrakech are fortress-like, often 20 to 30 feet thick and 30 to 40 feet high.The division in Islam, led to the invasion of the Bedouin. Around 1040 C.E., a group of Islamicized Berbers who had become affiliated with the Shia decided to take revenge. They neglected lands given to them by their caliph, defied the creeds of the Shia, and launched a rebellion among other Berbers to convertto the Sunni branch.These events no doubt led to vengeful reactions. The angry Shia caliph invited two tribes of Arabian Bedouin, known collectively as the Hilalians, to travel west and issue the Berbers' punishment. Africa is the first region into which Islam is carried by merchants rather than armies. It spreads down the well-established trade routes of the east coast, in which the coastal towns of the Red Sea (the very heart of Islam) play a major part. There is archaeological evidence from the eighth century of a tiny wooden mosque, with space enough for about ten worshippers, as far south as modern Kenya - on Shanga, one of the islands offshore from Lamu. Shanga's international links at the time are further demonstrated by surviving fragments of Persian pottery and Chinese stoneware.By the 11th century, when Islam makes its greatest advances in Africa, several settlements down the east coast have stone mosques.  At Kilwa, on the coast of modern Tanzania, a full-scale Muslim dynasty is established at this period. Coins from about 1070 give the name of the local ruler as 'the majestic Sultan Ali bin al-Hasan'.Three centuries later, the Muslim travelerIbn Batutafinds Kilwa an extremely prosperous sultanate, busy with trade in gold and slaves. In the 20th century Muslims remain either a majority or a significant minority in most regions of the east African coast. But the early penetration of Islam is even more effective down the caravan routes of West Africa.Islam in West Africa: 8th - 11th CenturyFrom the eighth century, Islam spread gradually south in the oases of theTrans-Saharan trade routes. By the 10th century, many of the merchants at the southern end of the trade routes were Muslims. In the 11th century the rulers began to be converted.From about the year 1000, the first Muslim ruler in the region is the king ofGao. The ruling classes of other communities followed suit. The king ofGhana, the most powerful realm, was one of the last to accept Islam (probably in the 1070s).The effect of Islam on African communities, with their own strong traditional cultures, was a gradual process. In 1352Ibn BatutavisitedMali, the kingdomthat replacedGhana. He was impressed by the people's regularity in saying their prayers, but he looked with stern disapproval at certain practicesthat weremore evidently African. He particularly frowned upon performances by masked dancers, and on the tendency of women to walk about in an unseemly shortage of clothing. Nevertheless the influence of Islam on this part of Africa is profound. From the Sudan to the Atlantic, the entire region north of the equatorial forests remains to this day largely Muslim.[Figure 9]A view of the minaret of the Great Mosque at Kairouan, Tunisia. Minarets are towers in mosques from which Muslims are called to prayer five times a day. Kairouan is said to be the fourth holiest city in Islam.Mali a Cultural CenterMansa Musa, greatest king of Mali, is shown on this Spanish map of AfricaWhat would life be like if a magician ruled the land? The history of ancient Mali gives us some hints. The founder of this West African kingdom was well known among his people as a man of magic with more than a few tricks up his sleeve.Before the sorcerer's reign, and the Malian kingdom's birth, years of competition and fighting took place in the lands west of the upper Niger River. A series of fierce battles took place, and in the 13th century CE, a group known as the Soso emerged victorious. The Soso's new lands, which had once belonged to the kingdom of Ghana, were like giant pots of gold. But before the Soso could settle in and enjoy the wealth, the great ""sorcerer-king"" Sundiata moved in to take over.The Lion KingSundiata claimed that Mali was his by right of inheritance and in 1230 A.D he defeated the Soso and took back the land. According to legend, Sundiata's rival, King Sumanguru, was also a sorcerer. Sumanguru conjured up the heads of eight spirits for assistance. Sundiata had stronger magic. He defeated the eight heads and then shot an arrow, which grazed Sumanguru's shoulder, draining him of all remaining magic. With a pat on the back, Sundiata declared himself ruler, ormansa, of the region and set up capital in the city of Niani.The mosque at Timbuktu was the heart of the kingdom of Mali. The empire of Mali expanded after the fall of Ghana, reaching its height under the rule of Kankan Musa (c. 1312-1327 C.E.). Many monumental mosques were constructed during the reign of Mansa Kankan Musa who is still remembered as a great Islamic ruler.In 1324, the great Mansa Musa set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Decked out in his finest clothes, he passed through Cairo with 500 slaves, each of whom carried a six-pound staff of gold. Backing them up were 100 camels, carrying in sum over 30,000 more pounds of the precious metal.In Mansa Musa's HandsAside from being generous, Mansa Musa made an important mark in Mali by introducing the kingdom to Islam and making it one of the first Muslim states in northern Africa. He incorporated the laws of the Koran into his justice system. Cities such as Timbuktu and Gao were developed into international centers of Islamic learning and culture. Elaborate mosques and libraries were built. The university arose in Timbuktu might well have been the world's first. The cities became meeting places for poets, scholars, and artists.Though not everyone accepted the new faith and culture, a strong relationship between religion and politics quickly developed. Mansa Kankan Musa ruled with all the ideals of a fine Muslim king. He died in the mid-14th century, and Mali was never quite the same. Internal squabbling between ruling families weakened Mali's governing and its network of states started to unravel. Then, in 1430, a group of Berbers seized much of Mali's territory, including Timbuktu.Islam in East Africa: 8th - 11th CenturyAfrica is the first region into which Islam is carried by merchants rather than armies. It spreads down the well-established trade routes of the east coast, in which the coastal towns of the Red Sea (the very heart of Islam) play a major part.  There is archaeological evidence from the 8th century of a tiny wooden mosque, with space enough for about ten worshippers, as far south as modern Kenya - on Shanga, one of the islands offshore from Lamu. Shanga's international links at the time are further demonstrated by surviving fragments of Persian pottery and Chinese stoneware.By the 11th century, when Islam makes its greatest advances in Africa, several settlements down the east coast have stone mosques.  At Kilwa, on the coast of modern Tanzania, a full-scale Muslim dynasty is established at this period. Coins from about 1070 give the name of the local ruler as 'the majestic Sultan Ali bin al-Hasan'.Three centuries later the Muslim travelerIbn Batutafinds Kilwa an extremely prosperous sultanate, busy with trade in gold and slaves. In the 20th century Muslims remain either a majority or a significant minority in most regions of the east African coast. But the early penetration of Islam is even more effective down the caravan routes of West Africa.Great ZimbabweThe word ""Zimbabwe"" is thought to be derived from a Shona phrase meaning ""stone enclosure"" or ""house of rock.""The House of RockIt's not the name of a dance club or a new band. It's actually a translation of the Shona word, ""Zimbabwe."" Though not the best illustration of the modern African nation, this phrase is a perfect description of the ancient city within its borders known as Great Zimbabwe. Sixty acres of immense stone ruins comprise the city and tell the story of the people who created and resided in it some 900 years ago.For a long time, many Westerners argued that such amazing structures could not have been crafted in Africa without European influence or assistance. These notions reflect ethnocentrism, or the tendency to view one's own culture as the best and others as inferior. With the help of modern dating techniques, today's archaeologists have been able to disprove these arguments and expose the truth. Africans, and Africans alone, were responsible for building this astounding and complex city.Shona SettlementThe first inhabitants of Great Zimbabwe were Shona-speaking peoples who likely settled in the region as early as 400 CE. Back then, the land was full of possibilities: plains of fertile soil to support farming and herding, and mineral rich territories to provide gold, iron, copper, and tin for trading and crafting. It was fine place for the Shona to call home.Over the years, descendants of the Shona made transitions from simple farming communities to more complex, stratified societies. By 1000 C.E., the population of Great Zimbabwe was divided and ranked by status — from elite leaders and their cattle to the peasants who did all the work. Cattle were very desirable and actually more valuable than most of the workers.Lifestyles of the Rich and FamousIn response to the changing social, political, and economic landscape, new buildings were gradually built. Tremendous stone houses were constructed by the peasants for their kings. Sophisticated workplaces were designed for conducting trades such as blacksmithing. The buildings were made of heavy granite blocks, stacked tightly together. Stones were arranged carefully, and no mortar was used to seal them together.The largest and most impressive building was an elliptical structure known today as the Great or Western Enclosure. The remains of its outer wall measure over 800 feet long and up to 32 feet high. The wall enclosed several huts and a tall, cone-shaped tower. Archaeologists and anthropologists believe that the enclosure was the city's center and was occupied only by the elite. It was the dividing line between the rich and the rest.Several clues led to this theory. First, remnants of exotic items from overseas were found within the enclosure. Second, no evidence of cooking was found within the walled area. Most likely, this means that food was prepared elsewhere by servants and delivered to the wealthy inhabitants upon demand. And third, evidence of only 100-200 residents is shown, while many thousands occupied the city.Where did everyone else live? They lived in mud huts surrounding the enclosure. Although the huts were not quite as glamorous as the granite ""palaces,"" they were well constructed.Long Live RockBy 1200 CE, the city had grown strong, and was well known as an important religious and trading center. Some believe that religion triggered the city's rise to power, and that the tall tower was used for worship. The people of Great Zimbabwe most likely worshiped Mwari, the supreme god in the Shona religion.Discoveries of Chinese porcelain, engraved glass from the Middle East, and metal ornaments from West Africa provide evidence that Great Zimbabwe participated in a comprehensive trade network during the 13th and 14th centuries. Gold was probably its chief export and East African cities — especially those along the coast that had overseas connections — were most likely its primary trading partners.Zimbabwe's prosperity continued until the mid-15th century. At this time, the city's trade activity declined and the people began to migrate elsewhere. The exact cause of the evacuation remains a puzzle, but many scientists agree that a decline in soil quality and fertility was probably a major factor. The Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe has declined, but the House of Rock still stands.Slave TradeSouth of the Mediterranean, the dynasties of Arabs along the coast stimulate an African slave trade. The town of Zawila develops in the Sahara in about700 specifically as a trading station for slaves. Captured in the region around Lake Chad, they are sold to Arab households in a Muslim world which by the 8th century stretches from Spain to Persia.Slavery is an accepted part of life in Arabia during the time of Muhammad, in the 7th century, and the Qur'an offers no arguments against the practice. It merely states, particularly in relation to female slaves, that they must be well treated. In general that has been the case, compared with the barbaric treatment of slaves in some Christian communities.West African slaves were marched to the coast for transport. An estimated 10 to 12 million West Africans were sold into slavery for the Americas and another 12 to 20 million were sent east to Arab lands.Video AssignmentMansa Musa and Islam in Africaby Crash CourseWho was Mansa Musa?

Warring clans, political murders, and foreign invaders characterized the next four centuries in which the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE), the Western and Eastern Jin (265-420 CE), and the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-588 CE) did little to build upon the accomplishments of earlier Chinese culture.The feuding clans of China were finally united once again in 589 CE by Wen-ti and the Sui dynasty (581-617 CE), a ruthless leadership often compared to the Legalist Qin regime. The Sui dynasty accomplished great feats, including another restoration of the Great Wall of China and the construction of the Great Canal linking the eastern plains to the northern rivers. However, the Sui taxed peasants heavily, and forced them into hard labor. Lasting only 36 years, the Sui dynasty weakened after suffering heavy losses in fighting against Korea. It fell apart when the general population lost faith in the government and revolted.History Repeating[Figure 2]T'ai Tsung was the most out-standing and dynamic ruler of the Tang dynasty and one of the greatest rulers of China.The rise of theTang dynastyin China mirrored the rise of the Han over 800 years earlier. Like the Han dynasty before them, the Tang dynasty was created after the fall of a ruthless leadership. And like the Han before them, the Tang dynasty had their own powerful leader, Emperor Tai-tsung.The first emperor of the Tang dynasty, Kao-tsu (618-626 CE), continued many of the practices begun during the Sui dynasty. He granted equal amounts of land to each adult male in return for taxes and continued the trend of local government rule. Kao-tsu also created a monetary system of copper coins and silk ribbons. He wrote a set of laws, revised every two decades that lasted into the Ming dynasty of the 14th century.One of Kao-tsu's sons, General Li Shih-min, succeeded in eliminating all political rivals of the Tang and established firm control of the Tang dynasty over the newly reunified China. He then proceeded to murder his brothers, and forced his father to abdicate the throne to him. Preferring his temple name, Tai-tsung took the throne in 626 CE. The Golden Age of China had begun.The Fruits of LaborTai-tsung maintained many of the political policies already in place. He shrank the government at both the central and state levels. The money saved by using a smaller government enabled Tai-tsung to save food as surplus in case of famine and to provide economic relief for farmers in case of flooding or other disasters. Civil exams based on merit were used once again and resulted in wise court officialsThe only major military pressure came from the Turkish frontier, but the Turks were defeated by 657 C.E., beginning 150 years of Tang control over the region. As a result of these improvements and victories, the common people were successful and content. It was during this successful era that woodblock printing and gunpowder were invented.Meanwhile, the borders of the Tang dynasty expanded far into Korea and central Asia. China became even larger during the Tang dynasty than it had been during the Han. The Chinese regularly communicated with lands as far west as Persia, present-day Afghanistan, and the Byzantine Empire. Goods and, more importantly, ideas continued to be exchanged on the Silk Road.The Melting Pot Boils OverThe capital cities of the Tang dynasty, Ch'ang-an and Loyang became melting pots to many cultures and a large number of beliefs such as Zoroastrianism and Islam. Buddhist missionaries had begun the difficult journey from northern India to China as early as the first century CE, but it was not until the Tang dynasty that Buddhism reached its height of popularity in China. By the mid-seventh century, new Buddhist schools of thought had developed a distinctly Chinese flavor, including the Ch'an school, which later evolved into Zen Buddhism.Chinese Trade Routes During the Tang DynastyThe Tang dynasty was a period of expansion, especially in trading with foreign lands. Caravan routes traveled as far as Syria for items ranging from glassware and tapestries to jasmine and other exotic herbs.However, during the late Tang period the economy was suffering. The emperor Wu-tsung, a devout Taoist, attempted to eliminate Buddhism from 843 to 845 CE by closing thousands of temples in order to take control of their wealth. Although the attempt to destroy Buddhism lasted only a short time, the religion never recovered, instead beginning a steady decline in China. The decline of Buddhism and conflicts between the Chinese and foreign traders marked the beginning of a change in Chinese attitudes. After hundreds of years of cultural exchange, by 836 CE no foreigners would be welcome in China.Poetic JusticeA great contribution of the Tang dynasty came years after the death of Tai-tsung, when the dynasty was at its political and economic height. The Tang dynasty was a golden age of art and literature for the Chinese. Li Po, Tu Fu, and Wang Wei were poets renowned for the simplicity and naturalism of their writings. The poetry and art of the times however were deeply affected by the rebellion of northeastern troops against court officials in the capital city of Ch'ang-an in 756 CE. Named after the leader of the rebel troops, the An Lu-shan Rebellion caused the deaths of countless people, including members of the royal family, and marked the beginning of the end for the Tang dynasty.The decline of the dynasty increased during the second half of the 9th century as factions within the central government began feuding. These feuds led to political plots and scandals, with assassinations not uncommon. The dynasty split into ten separate kingdoms as the central government weakened. After a series of collapses beginning around 880 C.E., northern invaders finally destroyed the Tang dynasty. The Golden Age was over.The Song Empire: 960-1279The rapid succession of the Five Dynasties was brought to an end by a warlord who wins power in 960. He established the sixth in the sequence on a more firm footing, as theSong Dynasty. He did so by reducing the power of regional commanders (keeping the best regiments under his own command at the center) and by giving greater authority to the civilian administration.As a result, this became the heyday of the Confucians. Ever since the Han dynasty, scholar officials had supposedly been selected by merit in the civil-service exams (Chinese examinations). But heredity and corruption have often frustrated this intention, reserving the jade insignia of office for the families of the powerful rather than the talented.Under the Song emperors, the search for talent grew rigorous. As an early Song ruler put it, ""bosoms clothed in coarse fabrics may carry qualities of jade,"" and he was determined that such bosoms would not ""remain unknown.""This resulted in a China weaker in military terms than its predecessors but of greater sophistication. The territory controlled by the Song emperors was gradually reduced under pressure from less civilized intruders, particularly from the north.Northern Song: 960-1127For the first half of the dynasty, known as Northern Song, the capital was at Kaifeng--an important center where theGrand Canaljoins the Yellow River. The city included 16 square miles within its walls and has an estimated population of more than a million people. It was not the only one of its kind. By the end of the dynasty Soozhou, Hangzhou and Canton (already the port for foreign merchants) were all of this size.In these great cities the Chinese enjoyed the fruits of trade (carried in exceptionally large merchant ships, and often negotiated in paper money), the benefits of technology (such as printing) and the aesthetic delights of pottery, painting, and poetry.These pleasures were interrupted from time to time by the demands of the Khitan, a tribe from eastern Mongolia who have settled in north China and have established their own version of a Chinese dynasty (the Liao, 907-1125). The Khitan were the first to make a capital city in what is now Beijing. They were such troublesome neighbors that the Song regularly made large payments to them (of silk, grain, copper and silver) in return for peace.A more drastic interruption occurs when another aggressive group from the northern steppes, the Jurchen, overwhelmed the Liao dynasty in 1125. Two years later they captured the Song capital, Kaifeng, and carried off the Song emperor and 3000 of his court, but even this disaster proved only a dislocation.Southern Song: 1127-1279A prince of the imperial family, avoiding capture at Kaifeng, established a new administration at the other end of the Grand Canal, at Hangzhou. Here the Southern Song continued for another 150 years, in territory reduced to a mere fraction of the China of the T'ang empire.But civilized Chinese life thrives in the exceptionally beautiful city of Hangzhou, at the heart of China's richest agricultural region - the rice fields of the south. It will continue to thrive until the arrival of another intruder, of a different caliber from all previous northern barbarians. Though not Chinese, he becomes emperor of China. He is perhaps the only emperor in Chinese history whose name is widely known: Kublai Khan.Paper Money in China: 10th - 15th CenturyPaper money was first experimented with in China in about 910, during the Five Dynasties period. It is a familiar currency by the end of the century under the Song dynasty. Another three centuries later, it would become one of the things about Chinathatmost astonishedMarco Polo.Italian Trader at the Court of Kublai KhanAt the height of the Mongol Empire, Marco Polo served Emperor Kublai Khan in China and returned to Venice to write an account of his experiences that would give Europeans some of their earliest information about China.Marco Polo was born in Venice, or possibly Croatia, in 1254. Located on the eastern coast of Italy, Venice served as a gateway to the riches of Asia during this era of increasing trade. Goods flowed like water through the city. Ships from around the eastern Mediterranean docked at its port. Merchants and traders set sail from Venice for Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the Black Sea to fetch goods from Russia and from merchants who traveled the Silk Roads, a system of trading routes to and from China that crossed the mountains and deserts of Central Asia.At the time of Marco’s birth, his father, Niccolo, and two uncles, all merchants, were away trading. Supposedly they were visiting cities on the Black Sea, but their adventures had actually taken them all the way to the Mongol capital of China, Khanbaliq (city of the Khan). There they had an audience with the most powerful ruler of the day, Kublai Khan, grandson of the founding emperor, Genghis Khan. When the three Polo men returned to Venice after an absence of 16 years, Niccolo found that his wife had died and that he had a 15-year-old son, Marco, whom he did not know existed. Two years later, in 1271 Niccolo Polo and his brother, Maffeo, set off aain, taking the 17-year-old Marco with them. This time they aimed directly for the court of Kublai Khan, to bring him document from the pope and holy oil from Jerusalem that he had requested. Even with a gold passport fro Kublai Khan, which enabled the travelers to use lodgings  and horses posted by the Mongols along the Silk Road routes, they took three and a half years to arrive. Upon reaching the summer palace of Kublai Khan in 1275, Niccolo presented his son and offered him in service to the emperor. After more than 16 years in China, the Polos begged permission from Kublai Khan to return home to Venice, Apparently they had proved so useful to the khan that he did not want them to leave. Finally, he agreed for them to escort a Mongolian princess, Cogatin, to become the bride of a Persian khan; thus they headed back west.by Cynthia Stokes BrownAll Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.[Figure 3]He describes in great detail how the notes are authenticated, and then unwittingly touches on the danger lurking within the delightful freedom to print money. He says that the emperor of China makes so many notes each year that he could buy the whole treasure of the world, 'though it costs him nothing'. By the early 15th century inflation has become such a problem that paper currency is abolished in the Ming empire.Chinese Publishing: 10th - 11th CenturyPrinting from wood blocks, as in the Diamond Sutra, is a laborious process. Yet the Chinese printers work wonders. In the 10th and 11th centuries all the Confucian classicswerepublished for the use of scholar officials, together with huge numbers of Buddhist and Daoist works (amounting to around 5000 scrolls of each) and the complete Standard Histories since the time of Sima Qian.The carving of so many characters in reverse on wood blocks is an enormous investment of labor, but the task is unavoidable until the introduction of movable type. This innovation, once again, seems2 to have been pioneered in China but advanced in Korea.Chinese Arts: in the Song DynastyIn the heyday of classical Chinese culture, a civilized gentleman - meaning a Confucian official - should be adept in three different artistic fields. When he settles down before a fresh sheet of paper and dips his brush in the ink (ground from a block of pigment by a servant), no one can be certain whether he is about to pen an impromptu poem, paint a quick impression of a romantic landscape or fashion some traditional phrase in exquisite Chinese characters.The three skills, all expressed in the beauty of brush strokes, are closely linked. A 'soundless poem' is a conventional Chinese term for a picture. And a typical poem by the Song master Ou-yang Hsiu sounded like a painting.Poetry and painting in Song China (960-1279)werelargely social activities, both in the creation and in the appreciation of the work. On a convivial occasion, with wine flowing, Confucians competed with each other in writing or painting. In more sober vein, among connoisseurs, a collectorwould bringthe scrolls from their boxes and unroll them to be admired and discussed.China's pastwasa theme for connoisseurs, in a fashion pioneered by Ou-yang Hsiu (and echoed centuries later in Italy during the Renaissance). Ou-yang Hsiu clambered ""on precarious cliffs and inaccessible gorges, in wild forests and abandoned tombs"" to make rubbingsthathe published, in about 1000 portfolios, as his Collection of Ancient Inscriptions.Inevitably much of the painting done by enthusiastic amateurs was dull and conventional. This was particularly true during the reign of the emperor Hui Tsung. Himself a talented painter, of a carefully exact kind, he set up an official academy of painting.Those who wanted to get on at court were unlikely to disagree with the emperor on matters of artistic style. Others, opting out of the system, came under the influence of Chan or Zen Buddhism with its emphasis on freedom of expression. The Chan painters of the Song dynasty, using a few quick brushstrokes to capture a fleeting visual moment, provided one of the most brilliant interludes in the story of Chinese art.Pottery of the Song dynasty: 10th - 13th centuryOf the many arts which thrive in China at this time, Song ceramics are outstanding. The simple shapes of the pottery and porcelain of this dynasty, and the elegance of the glazes (usually monochrome), have set standards of refinement admired in subsequent centuries throughout the world.Among the best known of these wares were theceladonswith their thick transparent green glazes, which are made at Longquan near the southern Song capital of Hangzhou. Also influential were the black wares known astemmoku, popular with Buddhist monks for the tea ceremony and exported in large quantities for this purpose to Japan.A Tower Clock in China: 1094After six years' work, a Buddhist monk by the name of Su Song completed a great tower, some thirty feet high, which is designed to reveal the movement of the stars and the hours of the day. Figures popped out of doors and struck bells to signify the hours.The power came from a water wheel occupying the lower part of the tower. Su Song had designed a device which stopped the water wheel except for a brief spell, once every quarter of an hour, when the water (accumulated in vessels on the rim) reached a sufficient weight to trip a mechanism. The wheel, lurching forward, drove the machinery of the tower to the next stationary point in a continuing cycle.This device (which in Su Sung's tower must have felt like a minor earthquake every time it slammed the machinery into action) was an early example of anescapement--a concept essential to mechanical clockwork. In any form of clock based on machinery, power must be delivered to the mechanism in intermittent bursts, which can be precisely regulated. The rationing of power is the function of the escapement. The real birth of mechanical clockwork awaited a reliable version to be developed in Europe in the 13th century. Meanwhile Su Sung's tower clock, ready for inspection by the emperor in 1094, was destroyed shortly afterwards by marauding barbarians from the north.The design of the Chinesejunk(a western word from the Malayan djong, meaning 'boat') was perfected during the later part of the Song dynasty, when the loss of the northern empire increased the importance of overseas trade. A merchant fleet, and a navy to defend it, became essential. The resulting junk was an ideal craft for the South China seas.The region suffered violent typhoons, so a strong hull was essential. The Chinese achieved this by means of the bulkhead--a partition across the interior of the hull, and sometimes along its length as well. Bulkheads make the hull rigid and also provided watertight compartments--invaluable when a leak at sea needs repair.The Chinese junk had other pioneering features later copied elsewhere. Traditionally built without a keel (allowing access to shallow waters), the junk was ill-equipped to sail a straight course until an important innovation of the Song period--the addition of the stern post rudder. This was a large heavy board that could be lowered on a sternpost when the junk moved into deep water. Coming below the bottom of the boat, and capable of hinging on its post, it fulfilled the function both of keel and rudder.[Figure 6]Until this time, throughout the world, the conventional method of steering a boat had been by means of a long oar projecting from the stern. Another important innovation on the Chinese junk were multiple masts. Marco Polo described sea-going junks as having four masts, with a further two that can be raised when required. Each mast had square-rigged sails. Theyconcertinaed, or collapsed, on themselves, when reefed, in the manner of a Venetian blind.These ships were huge. Marco Polo claimed that sixty private cabins for merchants could be built on the deck, and archaeological evidence suggests that by the 15th century, a large merchant junk was about 450 feet from the bow to the high poop in the stern--six times the length of the contemporary Portuguese caravel. In 1973 the discovery of a junk of the 13th century confirms much of what Marco Polo reported from the time of Kublai Khan.[Figure 7]Lovely Maiden binds her feetFootbindingFootbindingis the practice of binding a young girl's feet with cloth in order to restrict their size and control their appearance. Footbinding was practiced in China from the 10th century until the 20th century. Footbinding was initially reserved for the elites, particularly in north China, but by the 12th century, it had become popular among women of all social classes, including the poor.Like many other markers of beauty that are associated with the wealthy, bound feet were considered beautiful partly because a woman with bound feet could not work (and often could not walk), demonstrating her high status and wealth. In addition, in China, to have bound feet meant that a woman was disciplined, virtuous, and that she was brought up correctly. Parents looking for brides for their sons would find all of these traits attractive, so bound feet would not only be a sign of status but a marker of marriageability. The fact that a girl with bound feet could not walk also most likely meant that she was a virgin, making her even more attractive.Girls' feet were typically bound at the age of five or six, with tightly wound strips of cloth. Often the big toe was left unbound, but the other toes were folded down under the sole of the foot. Over a period of months and years, the bandages would be removed and the foot rewrapped. The result was that the feet would break and become more deformed as the girl reached adulthood, but would remain small and bent over. Many girls walked on their heels because the pain in the toes was so severe, leading to very hard heels. Once the healing process was over, however, and the bones had healed into their new position, the pain was no longer a problem. Other results included infection, paralysis, and muscular atrophy. Different-sized feet were called different names with the lotus of gold, which measured three inches, being the most sought after.Because of this intense attention on the feet, bound or lotus feet were fetishized, as were the lotus shoes made for them. There are questions today as to whether men were sexually aroused by the sight, touch, or smell of the feet. Some reports indicate that men fondled and licked the feet, while others indicate that the somewhat rotten smell had to be masked by perfume and that men would never see a woman's feet at all. In either case, prostitutes (both male and female) and concubines adopted the practice to make themselves more beautiful and sexually attractive.Footbinding was prohibited in China in 1911 but continued in isolated regions well into the 1930s. When the Revolutionary Party, which banned footbinding, found women in villages with bound feet, they forced them to unbind them, which caused almost as much pain as the initial binding. Unbound feet were known as ""liberated feet"" and some grew as much as an inch after unbinding. In 1998, the last factory to manufacture shoes for women with bound feet ended production. Some effects of footbinding are permanent: some elderly Chinese women today suffer from disabilities related to bound feet.Video Assignment2,000 Years of Chinese History!

22,4.1,"The Silk Roads, Indian Ocean, and Trans-Saharan Trade","[Figure 1]Caravan on the Silk Road by Cresques Abraham. Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.The Silk RoadsBy Khan AcademyIn the first century CE, during the reign of Emperor Tiberius, silk had become a big problem. The luxury fabric, imported at great cost from China, had become a symbol of decadence and excess among Romans. In order to make their supply of silk last longer, merchants unraveled and re-wove their fabric into thinner, sheer garments. This practice had a side-effect of making the garments nearly transparent.Seneca the Younger, a writer and imperial advisor, complained of people wearing silk:""I can see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes. ... Wretched flocks of maids labor so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife's body.”In the year 14 CE, the Roman historian Tacitus reported that the Imperial Senate made it illegal for men to wear silk, resolving that ""Oriental [Eastern] silks should no longer degrade the male sex. ""This prohibition on silk did not last. The demand for silk continued to drive trade between the Roman Empire, China, India, and many places in between. To understand whatcausedthis trade in silk, we need to look athowChinese silk got to Rome.Let's find out.State power and the Silk RoadOne cause of expanded trade was the growth of imperial power. Near the end of the second century BCE,Emperor Wu of Hanmounted many campaigns against the nomadicXiongnupeople. Xiongnu horsemen had raided Chinese settlements along the northern border for many years. Emperor Wu looked for a new source of horses for his cavalry in order to deal with the threat of the Xiongnu.Emperor Wu sent an emissary named Zhang Qian to find allies in the fight against the Xiongnu. Zhang returned to China, eager to discuss the wonders he had seen in Ferghana—modern-day Uzbekistan. Along with rice, wheat, and grapes, the region produced hardy, ""heavenly"" horses.[Figure 2]A ""Heavenly Horse"" of Ferghana, depicted in a 2nd century CE bronze sculpture from Han China. Image Credit: Wikipedia. This image is in the public domain.Ferghana horses became a highly-desired trade item in China. China imported so many horses that the Dayuan people who controlled the Ferghana valley refused to sell any more of the horses! This led to a three-year conflict known as the War of the Heavenly Horses. By 101 BCE, the Ferghana valley belonged to Han China. Control of the Ferghana valley also opened a route to the West.With a new supply of horses, Han China projected its new military strength throughout Asia. The expansion of Han control led to the firstPax Sinica—orChinese Peace. During this time, the standard of living in China rose and cities grew in size. Economic growth and political stability led to increased demand for luxury goods from far-off places.The Roman empire was expanding during this time, too. Victory in thePunic Warsgave Rome control over the western Mediterranean Sea. Over the next few centuries, Rome expanded to control all of the Mediterranean shoreline.The first century CE saw the beginning of thePax Romana—Roman Peace. ThePax Romanalasted about 200 years and was a period of relatively few wars. As with Han China, political stability brought more trade. Rome gained access to overseas trade routes to India via Egypt and began to trade regularly.Although Rome and Han China expanded greatly, there was still a lot of distance between them. Central Asia is covered with mountains, deserts, and vast grasslands. Traders provided an essential link between the Roman and Han empires.[Figure 3]Extent of Silk Roads. Image courtesy Wikimedia commons.Travel on the Silk RoadTraders had to find ways to move their goods efficiently. To travel overland, the camel was favored mode of transportation. Nomadic peoples in central Asia started domesticating camels as early as the second millennium BCE. For example, the Han Chinese used camels captured from the Xiongnu to carry military supplies. Camels could withstand the harsh desert conditions through central Asia and were also able to carry up to 500 pounds at a time! Pack animals—especially camels—made the transportation of goods over land on the Silk Road viable.[Figure 4]Relief with camel, Persepolis, Iran. Image courtesy Wikimedia Commons.Merchants and sailors made use of the ocean to transport goods, too. Sailors needed a strong understanding of wind patterns and storm systems to successfully navigate the oceans. For example, in the Indian Ocean, monsoon winds blow from the northeast in the winter and from the southwest in the summer. With a southwestern wind pushing them east, merchants were able to travel from the Red Sea between Egypt and Arabia to India in the summer and then back to the Red Sea in the winter. This information was exchanged among sailors and made its way beyond the Indian Ocean.[Figure 5]A map of the monsoon pattern, made by Khan Academy. Map shows the Red sea and the land surrounding it (east Africa, Saudi Arabia, India, southeast Asia). Blue arrows point south and west, showing the winter winds from the northeast. Red arrows point north and east across the Red Sea, showing the summer winds coming from the southwest.The effects of exchangeOne obvious effect of trade along the Silk Road was more goods were available in more places. Silk, owing to its soft texture and appealing shimmer, became so hotly desired that it was used as currency in central Asia. However, the process of raising silkworms and creating fabric from their cocoons remained a Chinese secret through the 6th century C.E. The fact that China remained the only source of silk meant that trade goods continued to travel across Asia. This involved many people and locations in the Silk Road trade networks.Spices from the East Indies, glass beads from Rome, silk, ginger, and lacquerware from China, furs from animals of the Caucasian steppe and slaves from many locations all travelled along the Silk Road.Some effects were cultural. During the rule of the Tang dynasty of China, for example, sculptures of camels from the caravans that frequently traded in China were placed in graves. Clearly the animals made an impression![Figure 6]Part of a 7th-century purchase contract, exchanging a fifteen-year-old enslaved person for six bolts of silk and five Chinese coins. This contract is from the city of Turfan, an oasis city along the Silk Road. Image credit: Wikimedia Commons user Discott, Creative Commons 3.0 License.Ideas and diseases were also exchanged along the sea lanes and camel-routes—and both would have profound effects on the locations they traveled to. Toward the end of the second century, a plague tore through the Roman Empire, killing 10% of the population. Historians think that this plague first appeared in China before making its way through trade routes to the Near East, where Roman soldiers were campaigning.As for the exchange of ideas, Buddhism came to China through trade with India. The Sogdians of central Asia often acted as traders between India and China. Sogdians also translated Sanskrit sutras into Chinese and spread the Buddhist faith as they traded. Other faiths, like Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, and Christianity also traveled along the sea and land routes. These religions developed andchanged to fit the new regions they traveled to.Chinese silk in RomeSo now we have a sense of the economic and political conditions that enabled Chinese silk to make its way to Roman markets. Both the Han Chinese and Roman Empires controlled vast territories and kept them relatively peaceful. The Han conquered their way into central Asia. From there, nomadic traders carried goods farther west or south. Trade brought new faiths, new ideas, and news to places they had not previously been.All Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Indian Ocean TradeWatch:Int'l Commerce, Snorkeling Camels, and the Indian Ocean Tradeby Crash Course World HistoryRead:The Indian Ocean: A Maritime Trade Network History Nearly Forgotby Adrianne DaggettDevelopment of New Trading CitiesBy Khan AcademyHangzhouPoetically called “The Paradise on the Earth,” the Chinese port city ofHangzhouis surrounded by rolling hills and mountains. When Marco Polo, an Italian explorer, visited the city in the late thirteenth century when he was middle-aged, it would have been bustling with exchange and people—over one million of them! Residents of Hangzhou enjoyed surpluses of fish and rice, goods the city also exported from within China. Foreign merchants enjoyed their own quarter, or section, within the city. By Marco Polo’s time, Hangzhou’s impressive Grand Canal—the world’s largest artificial river—was already over 600 years old. Stretching almost 800 miles, the Grand Canal’s main purpose was to ship grain to Beijing. The canal helped China stay well connected and well fed, which in turn allowed the country to be an active player in international trade.In addition to being the southernmost stop on the Grand Canal, Hangzhou was strategically located on the East China Sea, making it a natural center of trade. With access to the ocean and maritime trading routes, Hangzhou was adopted by the Song dynasty as its capital city in the thirteenth century.The Song dynasty’s strong economy and the success of Hangzhou went hand in hand. A surplus of food and goods allowed the Song dynasty and its capital to thrive by exporting goods such as rice, porcelain, silk, iron, steel, gunpowder, and paper. Hangzhou sent goods from the city and surrounding area to points on the Silk Road and to other, farther trade partners via maritime trading networks across the Indian Ocean. For example, Hangzhou was able to bring spices from South Asia to China.[Figure 7]Map of the Grand Canal, running from Beijing south to Hangzhou, approximately 1012 miles. Image credit: Wikimedia Commons.Timbuktu[Figure 8]A map of Timbuktu, also known as Tombouctou, and the trade routes to Morocco and Europe, to Egypt, and to Ethiopia and Arabia. Saharan trade routes. Image credit: Wikimedia.Another city that benefitted from its strategic location along trade routes wasTimbuktu,or Tomboctou. Located in modern-day Mali in West Africa, Timbuktu is situated on the Niger River and links North Africa with tropical regions farther south.Timbuktu was part of the Mali empire from the thirteenth century until the end of the fifteenth century. Malian rulers taxed the trade that passed through their realm, increasing the wealth of their empire. Scholars from North Africa were drawn to the economically stable city as a peaceful center where they could concentrate on learning. Malian rulers valued learning; they welcomed Muslim scholars and offered them places to eat and sleep.Especially valuable trade items that passed through Timbuktu included rock salt from the Saharan salt pans and gold brought by land from the south, in what is today Ghana. Enslaved people were also exchanged along the trade routes that passed through the city. These people were most likely non-Muslims who were brought from southern parts of Africa. They were traded mostly into North Africa but some of them ended up in the Saharan salt mines.Goods flowed from north to south as well. North African horses, weapons, books, and brass bowls changed hands in Timbuktu before heading south. All this trade was made possible through massive camel caravans—up to 25,000 camels connected Mali and North Africa!As with Hangzhou, Timbuktu thrived because it had a mutually beneficial relationship with its empire. When Timbuktu prospered, the Mali empire was able to tax trade goods, supporting economic stability. Economic stability in turn created a peaceful environment conducive to trade. Additionally, Malian rulers encouraged scholars to settle in the city. As a center for both learning and trade, Timbuktu was an influential part of the African trade system and a booming city.[Figure 9]Map of the Niger River and Map of the Niger River and surrounding modern-day republics, including Guinea, Mali, Niger, Benin, and Nigeria; Timbuktu is located in Mali on the Niger River. Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons.Malacca[Figure 10]A map of the Strait of Malacca, connecting China to India through trade routes. Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons.Another city that benefited from its location wasMalacca—also known as Melaka—in modern-day Malaysia. Established as a port city in the 1390s, Malacca lay at one end of astrait, a narrow passage of water connecting two bigger bodies of water. The city’s location is what is known as a maritime choke point—a segment of an important transportation route that is easily controlled. The Strait of Malacca was the shortest path between China and India, and thus was a frequently used trade route.In order to keep the waterway safe, local authorities under the Malacca sultanate, an independent Muslim state, oversaw and controlled traffic through the strait. Malacca rulers paid native residents of the areas around the Strait of Malacca—called theOrang Laut, or Sea People—to oversee the waterways around the strait and to chase off pirates. TheOrang Lautalso helped guide merchants to the city of Malacca. Thanks to the relationship Malacca maintained with theOrang Laut, Malacca was a safe travel and trade destination.Like the rulers of Hangzhou and Timbuktu, Malay rulers taxed the goods that passed through the strait—but not so heavily that people avoided the area. Local authorities kept a good balance of safety and a steady income for their dynasty, allowing the city to flourish and trade goods to pass freely from China to India.Impacts of urbanizationAccess to wealth, knowledge, and goods from far and wide droveurbanizationin places like Hangzhou, Timbuktu and Malacca. Although urban areas were usually less healthy places to live, trading cities pulled people to them with their thriving economies and job opportunities. These bustling cities became the places where cultures, ideas, and technological innovations were exchanged and spread.Video AssignmentWatch:The Silk Roadby Ted EdWhat factors hindered connections between early river valley civilizations?What was the relationship between nomadic people andSilk Road trade?What factors lead to the expansion of the SilkRoad?What role did the environment play in the development of the SilkRoad?Interactive Notebook AssignmentsCreate a graphic organizer of diffusion along Silk Road trade routes.Research and identify goods, technology, and ideas that made their way along Silk Road trade routes.What impact did diffusion have on connected regions?Making connections with the modern world.How has the modern world economy led to cultural diffusion today?Silk Road trade routes led to cultural diffusion in the Post-Classical period.Identify three specific examples of cultural diffusion today.Example:Fast Food in Arabiaby Vice NewsReview QuestionsWhy might economic growth and political stabilitylead tomore trade?How did environmental factors influence trade along the Silk Roads?Whatwastheeffect of silk only being produced in China?What were the impacts of trade beyond the moving goods?How did the Song dynasty affect Hangzhou’s success as a trading city?Why were scholars, especially Muslim scholars, drawn to Timbuktu?How did trade in Timbuktu help the Mali empire, and how did the stability of the Mali empire help the city of Timbuktu?VocabularySilk RoadA network of trade-routes that connected the east and west, was important to the economic interactions between different regionsPax SinicaChinese Peace, a period of time in which the standard of living rose and cities grew in size, economic growth boomed and political stability led to increased demand for luxury goods.Pax Romanaperiod of time in which the early Roman empire experienced peace and stabilityinteractioncommunication or direct involvement among different regionsdiffusionthe spread of people, things and ideas from place to placeurbanizationthe shift of people from rural to urban areasInternet ResourcesThe Silk Road and Ancient Tradeby The Crash Course World HistoryEarly Silk Roadby Khan AcademyIndian Ocean in World History bywww.indianoceanhistory.org Silk Road  A network of trade-routes that connected the east and west, was important to the economic interactions between different regions Pax Sinica   Chinese Peace, a period of time in which the standard of living rose and cities grew in size, economic growth boomed and political stability led to increased demand for luxury goods.  Pax Romana  period of time in which the early Roman empire experienced peace and stability interaction  communication or direct involvement among different regions diffusion the spread of people, things and ideas from place to place urbanization  the shift of people from rural to urban areas  [Figure 1] Credit: Cresques AbrahamSource: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Caravane_sur_la_Route_de_la_soie_-_Atlas_catalan.jpg  [Figure 2] Credit: L'art chinois.

Earnest and alarmingly buff knights (in shining armor, of course) engaged in against-the-odds quests to accomplish godly deeds in an evil world? Red crosses on pure white backgrounds? Orlando Bloom?This is not surprising. A quick look at our pop culture and politics in the West reveals a continued fascination with the crusades. Compared with popular representations, the historical reality is more complicated and often less heroic.How do we define the crusades?Imagine a man-at-arms in the French city of Clermont in 1095. He is listening to Pope Urban II—the only pope he has ever seen in person!—speak passionately about the need to fight in the Holy Land. His lord is persuaded, and gathers his men and resources. The man-at-arms says goodbye to his family, and departs in 1096 on years of painful journeying and military campaigns. He dies of starvation at Antioch, never seeing Jerusalem. His family never knows his fate. This was crusading.Now imagine Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily. Frederick regains Jerusalem from the Muslims without waging war—it helps that he knows Arabic. He is crowned the King of Jerusalem in 1229, but returns to Europe to find the pope waging war on his lands. This, too, was crusading—at least it was for some, though others, like the pope, disagreed.Finally, imagine an English knight in 1370. He plans to  travel to northeastern Europe to fight non-Christians and help Christians there expand their territory. He will go for a season, enjoy feasting and knightly camaraderie, then return home and go back to his regular life, with his reputation enhanced by his trip. You guessed it: this was also crusading.Crusading took many different forms, and attempting to precisely define crusading has engaged historians in intense debates for more than 150 years.Scholarly debatesMost of the debates among scholars are concerned with identifying the key characteristics of a crusade. Some, for example, consider only expeditions aimed at Jerusalem or the Holy Land to be crusades. This approach is responsible for the traditional, numbered crusades (i.e., First Crusade, Second Crusade, etc.).Others downplay the importance of a specific target, and emphasize instead characteristics related to authorization and procedure. These scholars would ask, did a pope authorize the expedition? Did participants take vows and receive certain legal and spiritual privileges? Taking this approach yields a larger number of crusades, spread over a larger geographical area and chronological range. At the same time, some question whether the role of authorities (i.e, the pope) determined a crusade as much as grassroots enthusiasm among ordinary people. These scholars would look, instead, for signs of mass popular support for an expedition. Still others assert that the characteristics of crusading were so diffuse throughout medieval culture that it is impossible and ultimately misleading to attempt to define what was or was not a crusade.It is also fair to say that many scholars recognize that one can spend too much time seeking a meticulous definition, in essence missing the forest for the trees!Outward signsIf crusading was so nebulous, how did potential participants know what a crusade was? Remember our man-at-arms in Clermont in 1095? He (and his lord) noticed preaching for a new expedition (perhaps emphasizing a papal proclamation, perhaps not), or heard people around him discussing it. Perhaps he also saw others taking public vows and wearing the sign of the cross on their garments. He may have learned of certain legal privileges designed to encourage participation and help protect property and families in the crusader's absence. Or perhaps he heard of a papal promise of an indulgence (“indulgence” in this context simply means a spiritual benefit of some kind—the precise kind of indulgence offered for crusading changed over time).Finally, our man-at-arms was interested in crusading, but for others, someone with authority over them (or someone they loved), may simply have told them it was happening or that they were going. Much like today, some people may have simply paid attention to their taxes; at times, especially in the later Middle Ages, both the Church and secular authorities levied funds for new expeditions. Any or all of these factors may have caught people’s attention, especially if they came from a family or region with a tradition of crusade participation. Meanwhile, for those who were the targets of crusader violence, presumably the only sign needed was the sight of an approaching army bedecked with crosses.Different points of viewWhile it’s valuable to seek to understand the crusades from the perspective of participants, it’s equally important to seek out different points of view. Internal criticism of the crusading movement was more limited than many today might expect. What criticisms existed were usually leveled at specific expeditions or participants, rather than at the idea of crusading in general or the underlying attitudes towards religion and violence that made crusading possible.Muslim voices, whether in the Iberian Peninsula (what is now Spain and Portugal), the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean), or further afield, described the crusades in different ways—often as simple territorial expansion, religious warfare, or a combination of the two. Descriptions of the “Franks” themselves (as the crusaders were called) ranged from respect to ridicule to hostility.Records from Jewish communities around the Mediterranean sometimes described an indiscriminating ferocity and zealous fervor held by many crusaders, a theme also underlined by Christians within Europe who did not conform to Church teachings, and thus were called “heretics.” Some accounts of the crusades from the Byzantine Empire (a medieval state based on the remains of the classical Roman Empire) emphasized the purported “barbarity” and relative naivete of the crusaders.How was crusading justified?Essay by Dr. Susanna Throop[Figure 2]Christ leading crusaders into battle, detail from an Apocalypse, with commentary (The ""Queen Mary Apocalypse""), early 14th century, f. 37 (British Library)Just warfareCrusades were wars—that is firm ground. More specifically, crusading was represented as just warfare, according to the idea of just war established by St. Augustine of Hippo.Augustine wrote that warfare was sometimes a necessary and lesser evil in certain conditions. Specifically, a war could be just if there was:a) just cause, b) legitimate authority, and c) right intention.A just cause was a previous injury or act of aggression. As a result, crusading was described as defensive.A legitimate authority was just that: an authority who held the power—granted by God, from Augustine’s perspective—to invoke war. Crusading, it was argued, was authorized by popes and legitimate secular leaders.Participants had the right intention if they believed war was completely unavoidable and sought only to use minimal force to check aggression against them. In theological terms, participants were supposed to be motivated by Christian love, (i.e. charity), rather than by anger, hatred, or fear. Crusade supporters stressed that participants were driven by the desire to help liberate purportedly oppressed Christians and save them from purported atrocities and slavery, and the desire to do the same for the personified Church or even Christ himself, both supposedly injured by the enemies of the crusaders.But participating in a just war could still be sinful. For example, Duke William II of Normandy’s invasion of England was considered just, but Norman participants had to do penance afterwards. So saying that crusading was a just war wasn’t enough. Many writers communicated that crusading was holy warfare, meaning that it was a just war that was not only authorized but also realized by God himself. In theological terms, then, God was the one taking action; God was the one waging war. Crusaders were divine tools, rather than moral agents in their own right. It was this belief that led one monk, Guibert of Nogent, to title his account of the First Crusade “The Deeds of God done through the Franks” (he was not-so-subtly revising an earlier, and in his opinion theologically crude account, titled “The Deeds of the Franks”). Of course, if a crusade was a holy war, then the enemies of crusading were enemies of God and the whole Christian faith, not just enemies of particular Christians—and that was precisely how Muslims and other crusader targets were depicted in many pro-crusade accounts.Penitential warfareFinally, crusading was also represented as penitential warfare. This means that crusading was believed to be an act of penance—a way to make amends to God for sins one had committed, so that an individual could achieve salvation. It means that crusading was not simply seen as a necessary evil—it was seen as a positive spiritual good for those who participated. Participants were not merely excused for their involvement; they actively acquired spiritual merit. In the simplest terms, crusading was presented as a good deed, even though it involved killing people.To make sense of this, we need to recognize that violence was often perceived to be much more morally neutral in medieval Europe than it is today. Violence acquired its moral value from intentions and context, like who was performing the violence and to whom it was done (this should remind you of Augustine’s just war theory: cause, authority, and intentions). Thus, the same action—let’s say, hitting someone in the face—could be immoral and unchristian in one context, and moral and Christian in another.Given the penitential element in crusading and the number of expeditions that involved long journeys to holy places, it is not surprising that crusading was often described as a pilgrimage, a journey to a holy location like a shrine, a church, or even an entire city, like Jerusalem. Those who went on pilgrimage frequently sought spiritual advantages, like forgiveness of sins or a closer relationship with God or a saint; they also sometimes hoped for more earthly advantages, like healing. Pilgrimage was a sacred act for medieval Christians, and was itself often an act of penance (sometimes voluntary, sometimes assigned by a priest in confession). Crusading borrowed some of the language, rituals, and symbols of pilgrimage, and shared its penitential nature.Changing definitionsIt’s important to emphasize again that people didn’t write a theory of crusading in advance. There wasn’t even a specific word for “crusade” until more than 100 years after the First Crusade. In addition, the nature of crusading seems to have operated differently and meant different things depending on time, place, and participants.The when, where, and who of crusadingEssay by Dr. Susanna ThroopSetting a timelineIn some ways, setting a beginning date for the crusading movement is relatively easy. The First Crusade was preached by Pope Urban II in 1095. Several different expeditions responded to this appeal, but the general dates for the First Crusade are 1096-1099, when the city of Jerusalem was conquered. Keep in mind though that crusading didn’t emerge from a vacuum, and many of the elements of crusading were circulating before 1095.However, finding an end date for the crusades is quite difficult indeed. Scholars used to stress that the heyday of crusading was before 1300. But we now know that crusading continued to flourish—as an ideal even when not in practice—for many centuries after that. Some place the end date at 1571, when the rising Ottoman Empire defeated the Kingdom of Cyprus at the city of Famagusta. Others place it in the late nineteenth century, when the last attempt at a military order (i.e., a Catholic armed religious order, like the medieval Knights Templar) ended. The argument can be made—and is in fact made by some groups around the world—that the crusades never ended at all.Theaters and targets[Figure 3]The First Crusade was launched at the Levant (the region at the end of the eastern Mediterranean) with the stated purpose of rescuing Christians and bringing the Christian holy places—specifically Jerusalem—back into (European) Christian hands.Of all the crusades to the region, the First was the most successful (from the perspective of European participants), and led to the creation of small polities in the Levant, known as the crusader states. European nobles first governed these small states, which were inhabited by some settlers from western Europe as well as native Christians, Jews, and Muslims.By the time the Second Crusade rolled around (1146-1149) crusading had already expanded dramatically. The Second Crusade took place on three fronts: against Muslims in the Levant, against pagans in northern Europe, and against Muslims on the Iberian peninsula (modern day Spain and Portugal). This does not mean that all three fronts were coordinated, as in a modern war. Rather, it means that contemporaries believed that the wars on all three fronts together constituted a larger endeavor.We should also remember that the Levant and Iberia contained any number of local Christians, Jews, and other religious groups, and they were not always exempted from crusader violence, even though it was held to be wrong to persecute or kill fellow Christians and Jews.After the Second Crusade, crusading continued to expand and evolve. Muslims (or areas under Muslim governance) continued to be targets, especially when they threatened or reconquered portions of the  crusader states, but other targets included Christian “heretics” (for example, in southern France), the Christian Byzantine Empire, and political opponents of the papacy within Europe.Crusading also developed local traditions. In northern Europe, crusading became a festive seasonal rite of passage for western European knights, complete with honorary feasts and prizes. In other places, crusading interacted with pre-existing factors, for example in Iberia, where both ideas of crusading and of the “Reconquest” were influential. In still other places, again in northern Europe but also Malta, the military orders—armed religious orders (most famously the Knights Templar)—set up independent, or virtually independent states dedicated to perpetual crusading.Participants[Figure 4]A departing or returning crusader being embraced by his wife, from the Belval Priory, Lorraine, late 12th century (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Nancy)Who went on crusade? From the beginning, popes and other leaders sought to encourage only professional men of war, whether kings, lords, knights, or simple men-at-arms, to go on crusade. And from the beginning, individuals of almost every other social class, age, and gender ignored this and wanted to go, too. The only people explicitly forbidden from going on crusade were those who had taken religious vows (like priests and monks), and even then, many tried to find a way to go—and, indeed, many went.This doesn’t mean that everyone in Europe was pulled inexorably into crusading like water down a drain. Crusading was expensive, and it was very risky. To go on crusade meant leaving your loved ones and your property (if you had any) vulnerable for at least several years and possibly forever. Going on crusade was not an “easy out” for younger sons (as used to be thought) nor was it a reliable treasure-hunting expedition; it impoverished many more people than it profited. Nonetheless, because of the spiritual and social rewards on offer for crusading, crusade leaders were never able to fully stop people of both genders and all classes from accompanying armed parties on crusade, and it is fair to say that many expeditions, especially those to the Levant, included a wide range of age, social classes, and military experienceThe Impact of the CrusadesEssay by Dr. Susanna ThroopIt is hard to summarize the impact of a movement that spanned centuries and continents, crossed social lines, and affected all levels of culture. However, there are a few central effects that can be highlighted.Military ordersFirst, the earliest military orders originated in Jerusalem in the wake of the First Crusade. A military order is a religious order in which members take traditional monastic vows—communal poverty, chastity, and obedience—but also commit to violence on behalf of the Christian faith. Well-known examples include the Knights Templar (officially endorsed in 1129), the Knights Hospitaller (confirmed by papal bull in 1113), and the Teutonic Knights (originated in the late twelfth century).The military orders represented a major theological and military development, and went on to play central roles in the formation of key political units that still exist today as nation-states.Wall plaque, Ascalon, mid-twelfth to mid-thirteenth century (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem). The Arabic inscription commemorates the wall built as defense against crusaders. The arms of the Englishman Sir Hugh Wake were later carved over that, confirming the 1241 crusader reconquest of the city.[Figure 5]Wall plaque, Ascalon, mid-twelfth to mid-thirteenth century. The Arabic inscription commemorates the wall built as defense against crusaders. The arms of Sir Hugh Wake (Lincoln, England) were later carved over that, confirming the 1241 crusader reconquest of the city.Territorial expansionSecond, crusading played a major role in European territorial expansion. The First Crusade resulted in the formation of the crusader states in the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean), which were initially governed, and in small part populated, by settlers from Europe.Crusading in northern and eastern Europe led to the expansion of kingdoms like Denmark and Sweden, as well as the creation of brand-new political units, for example in Prussia. As areas around the Baltic Sea were taken by the crusaders, traders and settlers—mostly German—moved in and profited economically.In the Mediterranean Sea, crusading led to the conquest and colonization of many islands, which arguably helped ensure Christian control of Mediterranean trade routes (at least for as long as the islands were held). Crusading also played a role in the conquest of the Iberian peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). This was finally completed in 1492, when the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I conquered the last Muslim community on the peninsula—the city of Granada. They expelled Jews from the country in the same year. And of course, they also authorized and supported the expeditions of Christopher Columbus, who—like many European explorers of his day—believed that the expansion of the Christian faith was one of his duties.Impact in Europe (religious and secular)Third, the crusading movement impacted internal European development in a few important ways. The movement helped both to militarize the medieval western Church and to sustain criticism of that militarization. It arguably helped solidify the pope’s control over the Church and made certain financial innovations central to Church operations. And it both reflected and influenced devotional trends. For example, while there was some dedication to St. George from the early Middle Ages, the intensity of that devotion soared in Europe after he reportedly intervened miraculously at the Battle of Antioch in 1098, during the First Crusade.Secular political theories were influenced by crusading, especially in France and the Iberian peninsula, and government institutions evolved in part to meet the logistical needs of crusading. Credit infrastructures within Europe rose to meet similar needs, and some locales—Venice, in particular—benefitted significantly in economic terms.It goes without saying that the crusades also had a highly negative effect on interfaith relations.Impact world-wideFourth, the crusading movement has left an imprint on the world as a whole. For example, many of the national flags of Europe incorporate a cross. In addition,  many images of crusaders in our popular culture are indebted to the nineteenth century. Some in that century, like the novelist Sir Walter Scott, portrayed crusaders as brave and glamorous yet backward and unenlightened; simultaneously, they depicted Muslims as heroic, intelligent, and liberal. Others more wholeheartedly romanticized crusading.[Figure 6]George Inness, Classical Landscape (March of the Crusaders), 1850, oil on canvas (Fruitlands Museum, Harvard, Massachusetts)These trends in nineteenth-century European culture impacted the Islamic world. Sometimes this influence was quite direct. In 1898 German Emperor Wilhelm II visited the grave of Saladin (Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb, a Muslim leader who led the recapture of Jerusalem in 1187) and was appalled at its state of disrepair. He paid to have it rebuilt, thus helping encourage modern Islamic appreciation of Saladin.[Figure 7]Kaiser Wilhelm II, visit to Jerusalem, 1898.Sometimes the European influence was more diffuse. Modern crusading histories in the Islamic world began to be written in the 1890s, when the Ottoman Empire was in crisis. After the Ottomans, some Arab Nationalists interpreted nineteenth-century imperialism as crusading, and thus linked their efforts to end imperial rule with the efforts of Muslims to resist crusading in previous centuries.It would be reassuring to believe that nobody in the West has provided grounds for such beliefs, but it would not be true. Sadly, the effects of the crusading movement—at least, as it is now remembered and reimagined—seem to be still unfolding.Video AssignmentWatch:The Crusades: Pilgrimage or Holy War?by Crash Course World History1.

Beginning in the Central Asian steppes, at its greatest extent, it included all of modern-day Mongolia, China, parts of Burma, Romania, Pakistan, Siberia, Ukraine, Belarus, Cilicia, Anatolia, Georgia, Armenia, Persia, Iraq, Central Asia, and much or all of Russia,. Many additional countries became tributary states of the Mongol Empire.The empire unified the nomadic Mongol and Turkic tribes of historical Mongolia under the leadership of Genghis Khan, who was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and then under his descendants, who sent invasions in every direction. The vast transcontinental empire connected the east with the west with an enforced Pax Mongolica, or Mongol Peace, allowing trade, technologies, commodities, and ideologies to be disseminated and exchanged across Eurasia.Mongol invasions and conquests progressed over the next century, until 1300, by which time the vast empire covered much of Asia and Eastern Europe. Historians regard the Mongol raids and invasions as some of the deadliest and most terrifying conflicts in human history. They spread panic ahead of them and induced population displacement on an unprecedented scale.The Beginnings of the Mongol EmpireBefore Genghis Khan became the leader of Mongolia, he was known as Temujin. When his young wife Börte was kidnapped by a rival tribe, Temujin united the nomadic, previously ever-rivaling Mongol tribes under his rule through political manipulation and military might. He defeated the tribe that had captured Börte and rescued her.[Figure 2]Genghis Khan Genghis Khan as portrayed in a 14th-century Yuan-era album. He was the first leader of the unified Mongols and first emperor under the Mongolian Empire.As Temujin gained power, he forbade looting of his enemies without permission, and he implemented a policy of sharing spoils with his warriors and their families instead of giving it all to the aristocrats. Because of this, he was a popular leader. However, these policies brought him into conflict with his uncles, who were also legitimate heirs to Mongol succession, as well as his generals.War ensued, and Temujin prevailed, destroying all the remaining rival tribes from 1203–1205 and bringing them under his sway. In 1206, Temujin was crowned as the leader of the Great Mongol Nation. It was then that he assumed the title of Genghis Khan, meaning universal leader, marking the start of the Mongol Empire.Innovations Under Genghis KhanGenghis Khan innovated many ways of organizing his army, dividing it into decimal subsections of 10; 100; 1,000; and 10,000. He also founded the Imperial Guard. He rewarded loyalty with high positions as heads of army units and households, even though many had originally been from very low-rank clans.He proclaimed a new law of the empire and codified everything related to the everyday life and political affairs of the people. He outlawed the theft of other's properties, fighting among themselves, and hunting animals during the breeding season.He also made changes regarding women in Mongol society. He forbade the selling of women, and continued to encourage the age-old tradition of allowing women to discuss major, public decisions. For example, unlike other Mongols and leaders in the region, Ghengis allowed his wives to sit at the table with him and encouraged them to voice their opinions. Apparently, they helped him decide the next khan. He eventually also allowed widows to choose to remarry--which was previously uncommon--to help keep them from poverty and other social ills.He appointed his adopted brother as supreme judge, ordering him to keep records of the empire. He decreed religious freedom and supported domestic and international trade. He exempted the poor and the clergy from taxation. Because of this, Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians from Manchuria, North China, India, and Persia, in fact, joined Genghis willingly long before his foreign conquests. He also encouraged literacy, adopting the Uyghur script, which would form the Empire's Uyghur-Mongolian script.The Mongol Empire Under Genghis KhanGenghis Khan initially forged the initial Mongol Empire in Central Asia with the unification of the Mongol and Turkic confederations on the Mongolian plateau in 1206. The Mongols invaded westward into Central Asia with the conquests of the Western Xia Dynasty in 1209, the Jin Dynasty in 1234, the Kara-Khitan Khanate in 1218, and the Khwarazmian Empire in 1221.These conquests seriously depopulated large areas of Islamic central Asia and northeastern Iran, since any city or town that resisted the Mongols was subject to destruction. Each soldier was required to execute a certain number of persons, with the number varying according to circumstances. For example, after the conquest of the city of Urgench, each Mongol warrior, in an army that might have consisted of 20,000 soldiers, was required to execute 24 people.By 1260, the armies of the Mongol Empire had swept with an overwhelming force out of the Asian steppes, utterly destroyed ancient and powerful kingdoms in the Middle East, and reached as far west as Egypt and Poland before halting their advance. During the same period, Mongol assaults on China replaced the Sung Dynasty with the Yuan Dynasty. The Mongols' military tactics, based on the swift and ferocious use of mounted cavalry, crushed even the strongest European and Islamic forces that took the field against them. They also learned primitive cannon and firearm technologies and brought these to the West.Conquest of the Western Xia DynastyWith the political rise of Genghis Khan in 1206 CE, the Mongol Empire shared its western borders with the Western Xia Dynasty of the Tanguts. To the east and south was the Jin Dynasty of northern China.Genghis Khan first planned for war with the Western Xia, correctly believing that the young, more powerful ruler of the Jin Dynasty would not come to the Western Xia Dynasty's aid. Despite initial difficulties in capturing the Western Xia's well-defended cities, Genghis Khan forced their surrender by 1209 CE.Conquest of the Jin DynastyIn 1211 CE, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan moved to conquer the Jin Dynasty. The Jin's army commander made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, he sent a messenger to Mongols. But the messenger defected and told the Mongols that the Jin Dynasty army was waiting for them on the other side of the Badger Pass. This was where the Mongols massacred thousands of Jin troops.In 1215 CE Genghis captured and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing). This forced the Emperor Xuanzong to move his capital south, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols. Between 1232 CE and 1233 CE, Kaifeng fell to the Mongols under the reign of Genghis' third son, Ögedei Khan. The last major battle between the Jin and the Mongols was the siege of Caizhou in 1234 CE, which marked the collapse of the Jin Dynasty.Conquest of the Kara-Khitan KhanateThe Mongol Empire conquered the Kara-Khitan Khanate, an empire of formerly nomadic people in Central Asia, in the years 1216-1218 CE. The khanate was under the rule of Prince Küchlüg, who had converted to Buddhism and begun persecuting the Muslim majority among the Khitan. This alienated him from most of his people.The Kara-Khitai attracted Genghis Khan's attention when they besieged Almaliq, a city belonging to vassals of the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan dispatched an army, who, under the command of General Jebe, defeated the Kara-Khitai at their capital, Balasagun, and Küchlüg fled. Jebe gained support from the Kara-Khitan populace by announcing that Küchlüg's oppressive policy of religious persecution had ended. When his army followed Küchlüg to Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Küchlüg, forcing him to flee again for his life. Jebe pursued Küchlüg into modern Afghanistan. According to Persian historian Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group of hunters caught Küchlüg in 1218 and handed him over to the Mongols, who promptly beheaded him.With Küchlüg's death, the Mongol Empire secured control over the Kara-Khitai and surrounding areas. The Mongols now had a firm outpost in Central Asia directly bordering the Khwarazmian Empire in Greater Iran. Relations with the Khwarazms would quickly break down, leading to the Mongol invasion of that territory in 1219.Conquest of the Khwarazmian EmpireIn the early 13th century, the Khwarazmian Empire was governed by Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he sent a caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, a Khwarazmian governor attacked the caravan, claiming that it contained spies. Genghis Khan sent a second group of ambassadors to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim ambassador beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors.Outraged, Genghis Khan organized one of his largest and most brutal invasion campaigns, consisting of 200,000 soldiers in three divisions. He left a commander and troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members, and set out for Khwarazmia. Before he left, he divided his empire among his sons and immediate family and declared that his heir should be his charismatic third son, Ögedei. His invasion of Khwarazmia would last from 1219-1221 CE. His son Jochi led the first division into the northeast, and the second division under Jebe marched secretly to the southeast to form, with the first division, a pincer attack on Samarkand. The third division under Genghis Khan and Tolui moved in from the northwest. The Shah's army, in contrast, was fragmented, a decisive factor in their defeat—the Mongols were not facing a unified defense.This conquest, even by the Mongols' standards, was brutal. They attacked the Khwarazm capital, Samarkand, using African prisoners as body shields. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory. Genghis Khan also ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians in cities he conquered and enslaved the rest of the population. He executed the Khwarazm governor by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes. Eventually, the Shah fled rather than surrender, and he died shortly after, possibly killed by the Mongols. After their victory, Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the empire, including not only royal buildings but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.In the city of Bukhara, Genghis Khan had the city's surviving population assemble in the town's mosque, where he declared that he was the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins.The assault on the wealthy trading city of Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal; they were not accustomed to city fighting. As usual, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves and the rest of the population was massacred. Persian scholar Juvayni states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing 24 Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2 million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the bloodiest massacres in human history.During the invasion of Transoxania in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle. They were used again in 1220 in Transoxania. The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs. In fact, historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia. One of these was the huochong, a Chinese mortar.[Figure 3]Chinese Formula for Gunpowder The earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Chinese Wujing Zongyao, a military compendium, of 1044 CE.By the time of Genghis Khan's death in 1227, the Mongol Empire ruled from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea, an empire twice the size of the Roman Empire and Muslim Caliphate.Pushing Further WestThe Mongols conquered the areas today known as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Caucasus, and parts of Turkey. Further Mongol raids reached southwards as far as Gaza into the Palestine region in 1260 and 1300. The major battles were the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, when the Mongols sacked the city that for 500 years had been the center of Islamic power, and the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, when the Muslim Egyptians were for the first time able to stop the Mongol advance.The Mongols were never able to expand farther west than the Middle East due to a combination of political and environmental factors, such as lack of sufficient grazing room for their horses.Expansion of the Mongol Empire Under ÖgedeiÖgedei, Genghis Khan's third son, took over from his father and ruled the Mongol Empire from 1227 CE-1241 CE. One of his most important contributions to the empire was his conquest of Eastern Europe. These conquests involved the invasions of Russia, Hungary, Volga Bulgaria, and Poland. Over the course of three years (1237–1240), the Mongols would annihilate all the major East Slavic cities except for Novgorod and Pskov. As a result of the successful invasions, many of the conquered territories would become part of the Mongol Empire.[Figure 4]By derivative work: Bkkbrad (talk)Gengis_Khan_empire-fr.svg: historicair 17:01, 8 October 2007 (UTC) - Gengis_Khan_empire-fr.svg, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4534962The operations were masterminded by General Subutai and commanded by Batu Khan and Kadan, both grandsons of Genghis Khan. The Mongols had acquired Chinese gunpowder, which they deployed in battle during the invasion of Europe to great success, in the form of bombs hurled via catapult. The Mongols are in fact credited for introducing gunpowder and associated weapons into Europe.Invasion and Conquest of Russian LandsÖgedei Khan ordered his nephew (and grandson of Genghis Khan) Batu Khan to conquer Russia in 1235. (The territory was then called Rus' and encompassed modern-day Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, and the Baltic states. ) The main force arrived at Ryazan in December 1237. Ryazan refused to surrender, and the Mongols sacked it and then stormed through other Russian cities. Russian armies were defeated, and Grand Prince Yuri was killed in 1238. Major Russian cities—such as Vladimir, Torzhok, and Kozelsk—were captured.Afterward, the Mongols turned their attention to the steppe, crushing various tribes and sacking Crimea to the west. They returned to Russia in 1239 and sacked several more cities. Most Russian princes fled. The Mongols sacked Kiev in 1240.Invasion into Central EuropeThe Mongols invaded Central Europe with three armies. One army defeated the fragmented Poland at the Battle of Legnica in 1241. Two days later the armies regrouped and crushed the Hungarian army at the Battle of Mohi, killing half the Hungarian population. In 1242, the Mongols extended their control into Austria and Dalmatia and Moravia. Where they found local resistance, they ruthlessly killed the population. Where the locale offered no resistance, they forced the men into servitude in the Mongol army.End of the Mongol AdvanceThe Mongols had pushed into Hungary, and were prepared to go into Western Europe. Hungarians who had survived the initial attack, or never engaged n battle, had begun a guerilla attack lead by survivors of the Hungarian royal family. The Mongols, even though still strong, were suffering defeats during these attacks. They never had a chance to regroup: Ögedei died in December 1241 after binge drinking during a hunting trip. Upon hearing the news, the Mongol forces halted their westward expansion and hastened back the thousands of miles to Karakorum, their capital in Mongolia, to elect his successor, sparing Western Europe from further violence.Möngke the popular ruler of the Mongol EmpireFrom Ögedei's death in 1241 CE until 1246 CE the Mongol Empire was ruled under the regency of Ögedei's widow, Töregene Khatun. She set the stage for the ascension of her son, Güyük, as Great Khan, and he would take control in 1246. He and Ögedei's nephew Batu Khan (both grandsons of Genghis Khan) fought bitterly for power; Güyük died in 1248 on the way to confront Batu.Another nephew of Ögedei's (and so a third grandson of Genghis Khan's), Möngke, then took the throne in 1251, with Batu's approval. In 1255, well into Möngke's reign, Batu had repaired his relationship with the Great Khan and so finally felt secure enough again to prepare to return to invading westward into Europe. Fortunately for the Europeans, however, he died before his plans could be implemented.The Mongol Empire Under Möngke[Figure 5]Asia laea relief location map.jpg. Data source: partially based on ""Mongolian National Atlas"", 2009 2014. Author KhirugeMöngke forbade extravagant spending and limited gifts to the princes. He made merchants subject to taxes. He prohibited the demanding of goods and services from civilian populations by merchants, and he punished the unauthorized plundering of civilians by generals and princes (including his own son).In 1253, Möngke established the Department of Monetary Affairs to control the issuance of paper money in order to eliminate the over issue of currency that had been a problem since Ögedei's reign. He standardized a system of measurement based on the silver ingot. Möngke recognized that if he did not meet Güyük's financial obligations, it would make merchants reluctant to continue business with the Mongols. Like many other rules around the world at this time, his hope was to take advantage of the budding commercial revolution in Europe and the Middle East. So he paid out all debts drawn by high-rank Mongol elites to these merchants. Ata-Malik Juvaini, a 13th-century Persian historian, commented on the virtue of this move, saying, ""And from what book of history has it been read or heard...that a king paid the debt of another king? ""The Mongol Empire's administration followed a trend that was occurring in the Western Europe, where kings and emperors were finding efficient ways to manage their administrative and legal systems and fund crusades, conquests, and wars. From 1252–1259, Möngke conducted a census of the Mongol Empire including Iran, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, Russia, Central Asia and North China. The new census counted not only households but also the number of men aged 15–60 and the number of fields, livestock, vineyards, and orchards.Möngke tried to create a fixed poll tax collected by imperial agents, which could forward to the needy units. He taxed the wealthiest people most severely. But the census and taxation sparked popular riots and resistance in the western districts. These rebellions were ultimately put down, and Möngke would continue to rule until his death in 1259.The Mongol Empire Under Kublai Khan: The Yuan DynastyMöngke's death in 1259 led to civil war between his two younger brothers, Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke. Kublai Khan emerged victoriously and established the Yuan Dynasty in China in 1271, perhaps the Mongols' greatest triumph, though it would eventually be overthrown in 1368 by the native Han Chinese, who would launch their own Ming Dynasty.[Figure 6]Kublai Khan ruled as the Khagan of the Mongol Empire from 1260 to 1271. From 1271 until his death in 1294 he was the emperor of China, establishing the Yuan dynasty that would end in 1368. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/YuanEmperorAlbumKhubilaiPortrait.jpgThe Mongols under Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty invaded Sakhalin Island between 1264 and 1308. They also invaded Burma in 1277, 1283 and 1287, resulting in Burma's capitulation and the disintegration of the Pagan Kingdom. The invasions of Vietnam and Java resulted in defeat for the Mongols, although much of South Asia agreed to pay tribute in order to avoid further bloodshed.In the south, after the fall of Xiangyang in 1273, the Mongols sought the final conquest of the Song Dynasty in South China. In 1271, Kublai renamed the new Mongol regime in China as the Yuan Dynasty, and he sought to strengthen his image as Emperor of China in order to win the control of the millions of Chinese. Kublai moved his headquarters to Dadu, what later became the modern city of Beijing. His establishment of a capital there was a controversial move to many Mongols who accused him of being too closely tied to Chinese culture.The Mongols were eventually successful in their campaigns against China; the Chinese Song imperial family ultimately surrendered to the Yuan in 1276, making the Mongols the first non-Chinese people to conquer all of China. However, Kublai Khan's costly invasions of Burma, Annam, Sakhalin and Champa secured only the vassal status of those countries, and Mongol invasions of Japan (1274 and 1280) and Java (1293) failed.Kublai Khan made significant reforms to existing institutions under the Yuan Dynasty. He divided the Dynasty's territory into a central region and peripheral regions that were under the control of various officials. He created an academy, offices, trade ports and canals, and sponsored arts and science. Mongol records also list 20,166 public schools created during his reign. He also, along with engineers, invented the Muslim trebuchet (hui-hui pao), a counterweight-based weapon that was highly successful in battle. He also continued to welcome trade and travel throughout his empire. Marco Polo; his father, an Italian merchant; and his father's trade partner traveled to China during this time, met Kublai Khan and lived amongst his court. Polo generally praised the wealth and extravagance of Khan and the Mongol Empire. Some historians also speculate that trade was so accessible between the empire and Europe, that it may have contributed to the flow of disease, especially the black plague in the mid-1300s.[Figure 7]Trebuchet The scheme of the ""Muslim trebuchet"" (hui-hui pao), invented during Kublai Khan's rule.The Development of the Mongol Empire into Four KhanatesBy the time of Kublai's death in 1294, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate empires, that was based on administrative zonesGenghishad created. The four empires were known as khanates, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the Golden Horde Khanate in the northwest, the Chagatai Khanate in the west, the Ilkhanate in the southwest, and the Yuan Dynasty, based in modern-day Beijing. In 1304, the three western khanates briefly accepted the rule of the Yuan Dynasty in name, but when the Dynasty was overthrown by the Han Chinese Ming Dynasty in 1368, the Mongol Empire finally dissolved.[Figure 8]Map showing changes in borders of the Mongol Empire from founding by Genghis Khan in 1206, Genghis Khan's death in 1227 to the rule of Kublai Khan (1260–1294).

Alp Arslan follows his success here with an attack on Georgia, in 1068. These acts of aggression prompt a response from the Byzantine emperor, Romanus IV Diogenes.The armies meet in 1071 at Manzikert, near Lake Van. The battle, a resounding victory for the Seljuks, is a turning point in the story of the Byzantine empire. Within a few years there are Turkish tribes in many parts of Anatolia. Some of them are bitter enemies of the Seljuks, but the Seljuks are now the main power in this borderland between Islam and Christianity.The Seljuks and the sultanate of Rum: 11th - 13th c.Rum, meaning Rome, is the word used by the Turks for Byzantium (whose officials still describe themselves as Romans, in keeping with the origins of the Byzantine empire). Pressing deep into Anatolia, after the victory at Manzikert in 1071, the Seljuks reach Konya in the following year and Nicaea, much closer to Constantinople, in about 1080. They make Nicaea their capital until it is recovered by the Byzantines during the first crusade, in 1097. In 1099 Konya, strategically placed in the center of Anatolia, becomes the Seljuk capital.The Seljuks describe their new territory, at the heart of the old Byzantine empire, as the sultanate of Rum.Throughout the 12th and 13th century Anatolia is in turmoil. Turkish tribes fight among themselves. The Byzantines try to recover their land. Crusaders, passing through and from 1204 occupying Constantinople, complicate the picture.But the new and overriding feature is that Anatolia is now largely occupied by Turks. This fact enters the languages of the period. In addition to its many other names, the region begins to be referred to as Turkey - the land of the Turks. The new identity survives the arrival of the Mongols in the 13th century and the end of the Seljuk dynasty in the early 14th century. By then another Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, are making their mark.The Ottoman Turks: 13th - 14th centuryDuring the 13th century, when many Turkish emirates are being established in Anatolia, a petty chieftain by the name of Ertughrul wins control over a limited area around Sögüt, between Ankara and Constantinople. He is succeeded in about 1285 by his son Osman, whose name is a Turkish version of the Arabic Othman. Through Osman, seen later as founder of the dynasty, his people become known as the Ottoman Turks.Most of the Turks of Anatolia live in a style in keeping with their origins, as fierce nomads of the steppes. Riding out to war is their everyday activity. But they are also keen Muslims. They see themselves as ghazi, an Arabic word for warrior but with religious connotations.Turks setting out on a ghaza (armed raid) are indulging in an expedition of plunder but also in a jihad (holy war). It is a potent combination. The enfeebled Byzantine Empire to the west of their territory - crippled, ironically, by the Christian fourth crusade - provides the Ottoman Turks with a natural target.Progress is at first slow. The Ottoman horsemen lack the equipment to take fortified Byzantine towns. Instead, they plunder the surrounding countryside, effectively strangling their victims into submission. Bursa, the first important Byzantine stronghold to the west, falls to them in 1326, the year of Osman's death.After the fall of Bursa the Ottoman advance quickens. Nicaea yields in 1331 and Nicomedia in 1337. In that direction, a narrow neck of land leads directly to Constantinople, but the Ottomans prefer a roundabout route. In 1354 they cross into Europe at the other end of the Sea of Marmara, capturing Gallipoli. Eight years later Adrianople falls to them, severing the main route westwards from Constantinople.A stranglehold is being applied to the Byzantine capital itself, but the Turks look first for plunder in an easier direction. They continue westwards into the Balkans, where their successes prompt the formation of the formidable Ottoman fighting force known as the Janissaries.The Turks in the Balkans: 1389 - 1402A victory at Kosovo in 1389 brings Serbia under Ottoman control as a vassal state. The Ottoman sultan Murad I dies on the battlefield of Kosovo and is succeeded by his son Bayazid I, whose name Yildirim ('Thunderbolt') reflects his early military successes. The Slav kingdom of Bulgaria is fully occupied by 1393. In the following year Bayazid begins the long expected blockade of Constantinople. A Hungarian army marching as a crusade against the Turks is heavily defeated at Nicopolis in 1396. Meanwhile the sultan campaigns south into Greece. But then the Balkans and Constantinople are given a sudden reprieve.Bayazid is confronted by a major threat in Anatolia - the arrival of Timur.Devshirme and the Millet SystemDevshirme (literally ""collecting"" in Turkish), also known as the blood tax or tribute in blood, was chiefly the annual practice by which the Ottoman Empire sent the military to abduct boys, sons of their Christian subjects (Rum millet and Armenians) in the villages of the Balkans and Anatolia. The ideal age of a recruit was between 7 and 10 years of age, although they recruited much younger boys. The devshirme system was locally resented and was resisted, even to the point of disfiguring their sons. Nonetheless, many were then converted to Islam with the primary objective of selecting and training the ablest children for the military or civil service of the Empire, notably into the Janissaries.The Ottoman Empire, beginning with Murad I, felt a need to ""counteract the power of (Turkic) nobles by developing Christian vassal soldiers and converted kapıkulları as his personal troops, independent of the regular army."" The elite forces, which served the Ottoman Sultan directly, were divided into two main groups: cavalry and infantry.[b] The cavalry was commonly known as the Kapıkulu Süvari (The Cavalry of the Servants of the Porte) and the infantry was the popular Yeni Çeri (transliterated in English as Janissary), meaning ""the New Corps"".At first, the soldiers to serve in these corps were selected from the slaves captured during warfare. However, the system commonly known as devşhirme was soon adopted: in this system children of the rural Christian populations of the Balkans—particularly Albanians, Serbs, and northern Greeks—were conscripted before adolescence and were brought up as Muslims. Upon reaching adolescence, these children were enrolled in one of the four imperial institutions:The PalaceThe Scribes,The ReligiousThe MilitaryThose enrolled in the Military would become either part of the Janissary corps, or part of any other corps. The brightest were sent to the Palace institution (Enderun), and were destined for a career within the palace itself where the most capable could aspire to attain the very highest office of state, that of Grand Vizier, the Sultan's immensely powerful chief minister and military deputy.In the Ottoman Empire, a millet was a separate legal court pertaining to ""personal law"" under which a confessional community (a group abiding by the laws of Muslim Sharia, Christian Canon law, or Jewish Halakha) was allowed to rule itself under its own system.People were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their confessional communities), rather than their ethnic origins, according to the millet concept. The head of a millet – most often a religious hierarch such as the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople or, in earlier times, the Patriarch of the East – reported directly to the Ottoman Sultan. The millets had a great deal of power – they set their own laws and collected and distributed their own taxes. All that was required was loyalty to the Empire. When a member of one millet committed a crime against a member of another, the law of the injured party applied, but the ruling Islamic majority being paramount, any dispute involving a Muslim fell under their sharia−based law.Timur and the Chagatai Turks: 14th centuryThe regions north and south of the Hindu Kush, approximating to modern Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, form an indeterminate part of the empire of Genghis Khan. They are inherited by descendants of his son Chagatai, but the district is fought over by many rival cousins. Here, more than anywhere in the Mongol empire, the Turkish influence is all-pervasive. By the end of the 14th century, even the fiercely competitive petty princes of the region are vague as to whether they are Mongols or Turks - a fact reflected in their contradictory name. They are known as Chagatai Turks.The greatest of them is born near Samarkand in 1336. His name is Timur, but he is more familiar in the west as Tamerlane.Timur is known in his local variety of Turkish as Timur I Leng, meaning Timur the Lame. It is this phrase which has been transliterated in European accounts as Tamerlane (also spelled Tamburlaine).Timur sees himself as restoring the great Mongol empire. Like Genghis Khan, two centuries earlier, he spends the first half of his life establishing control over local rivals. He is almost fifty when he begins, in 1383, an astonishing two decades of far-flung military campaigns. During them he reconquers, single-handed, the western half of the Mongol empire.Timur's conquests:1383 - 1405Timur begins his campaign with the capture in 1383 of Herat, a city on the border of Afghanistan and Iran which will later, under his own descendants, become a great centre of Persian culture. In the next two years he subdues the whole of eastern Persia.By 1394 he has extended his rule throughout Persia and Mesopotamia and up between the Black Sea and Caspian into Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. In 1396 he storms into Russia and occupies Moscow for a year.Timur's rule is brutal. In Persia frequent uprisings are put down with a severity similar to that of Genghis Khan. Populations of entire cities are massacred, and Timur develops an effective new form of memento mori. The skulls of the dead form the masonry for towers; firmly cemented together to stand as cautionary tales.In 1398 Timur outdoes one of Genghis Khan's expeditions. He invades India, but unlike his predecessor, he does not stop at the Indus. He marches on to Delhi and devastates the city. He then spends several months collecting treasure, which he carries home on 120 elephants.Home is Samarkand, the city closest to his birthplace. Timur is busy turning it into a great center of Muslim architecture and art. Together with the Indian elephants come the best craftsmen of Delhi, who will be set to work in Samarkand - where they join, in 1399, a community of skilled captives from previous expeditions.The conqueror himself, now in his mid-sixties, has more practical business to attend to. Before the end of 1399, he marches west to restore order in his outlying provinces.The conqueror's declining years: 1401-1405In 1401, in Syria, Timur defeats a Mameluke army from Egypt. He then takes and destroys Damascus, dispatching a new consignment of talented craftsmen back to Samarkand. Later in the same year Baghdad is stormed and sacked, and 20,000 of its population massacred. In 1402 the aged warrior advances into Anatolia. He defeats an army of Ottoman Turks near Ankara, capturing their sultan, Bayazid I (who dies in Timur's care). He then moves on west, as far as the Aegean, to take Izmir from the Knights of Rhodes.By 1404 he is back in Samarkand. But even now, two years short of seventy, he is not ready to settle. He has set his sights on an even more ambitious project.Late in 1404 Timur rides east to invade China. He gets no further than Chimkent before he falls ill, in January 1405, and dies.Though he has reconquered much of the western Mongol empire, it is the example of Samarkand which most influences his descendants (known as the Timurids). His domed mausoleum, the Gur Amir, decorated with blue ceramic tiles, begins the tradition of Muslim buildings developed at Herat and Isfahan. A century later, an inherited interest in art brings superb results at the court of a family descended from both Timur and Genghis Khan - the Moghul emperors of India, whose name perpetuates the memory of the Mongol dynasty.The Timurid tradition: 1405-1510Shahrukh, Timur's favorite son, is his family's greatest patron of the arts. From about 1405 he rebuilds Herat, devastated by his father in 1383, and actively encourages the Persian school of miniature painting - which has already begun to flourish under the patronage of the Mongol Il-Khans.With some difficulty, Shahrukh maintains control over the empire conquered by his father in central Asia and Persia. In subsequent generations the descendants of Timur fight constantly among themselves over their shared inheritance, weakening their joint defense against their enemies. But Herat remains a center of Timurid civilization until it falls, in 1510, to the founder of the new Safavid dynasty.Retrenchment and recovery: 1402 - 1481The Ottoman domain shrinks drastically after Bayazid's defeat and capture by Timur in 1402. The many small emirs of Turkey reassert their independence, as do the Balkan states. The three sons of Bayazid are left with only the family's central territories around the southern and western sides of the sea of Marmara. They fight each other in a civil war which is won by the youngest, Mehmed I, in 1413.From this unpromising position, the son and grandson of Mehmed (Murad II and Mehmed II, whose combined reigns span nearly seventy years) achieve an astonishing recovery for the Ottoman state - posing an ever greater threat to the Byzantine empire.Murad patiently reasserts control over much of western Anatolia, and makes equivalent headway in the Balkans. Serbia is brought back into the Ottoman fold (Murad marries a Serbian princess in 1433). Much of Bulgaria also is recovered. A strong counter-attack down the Danube in 1443 by an army of Hungarians and Poles is at first successful until the Ottoman Turks win a decisive victory at Varna in 1444.This steady process is continued by Murad's son, Mehmed II.Mehmed II conquers Athens and almost the whole of the Greek peninsula in 1458-60. He then engages in a prolonged war with Venice, winning many valuable ports along the Adriatic coast. In 1463-4 he captures Bosnia where a large number of nobles convert to Islam, unlike neighboring Serbia which remains largely Greek Orthodox - a distinction with resonance in more recent history. By the time of Mehmed's death, in 1481, Anatolia has also been recovered. Even regions north of the Black Sea are vassal states.But the achievement which gives Mehmed his title of Fatih (Conqueror), and his secure place in history, has been his capture in 1453 of Constantinople.Fall of Constantinople: 1453A month after his twenty-first birthday, in April 1453, Mehmed II applies to Constantinople the stranglehold which has been a tacit threat for nearly a century, ever since the Ottoman capture of Adrianople (Edirne in its Turkish name) in 1362. He initiates a tight blockade of the city by both sea and land.The inhabitants, as often before, place their faith in their immensely strong city walls. Only on the harbor side are these walls vulnerable, and the harbor (the long creek known as the Golden Horn) is protected by a great chain preventing enemy ships from entering. But the young sultan has an answer to that.At dawn, one Sunday morning in May, the defenders on the walls are surprised to see Muslim ships in the harbor. During the night they have been dragged on wheeled carriages, on a temporary wooden roadway, over a 200-foot hill. Over the next few days, cannons are moved into place, including one 19-ton bombard. At sunset on the 28th of May, the attack begins. Every bell in the city rings the alarm. Santa Sophia is full of people praying and singing Kyrie Eleison (Lord, have mercy).By dawn the Turks are in the city. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, has died in the fighting.Mehmed, the sultan, goes straight to Santa Sophia to hear a proclamation from the pulpit - that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet. The great church, for many centuries the most magnificent in Christendom, now begins its career as a mosque. And Constantinople gradually acquires a new name; the urban area, widely referred to in everyday Greek as is in polis (in the city), becomes Istanbul.The Ottoman army is allowed three days of pillage (a depressing convention of medieval warfare), but Mehmed keeps it under tolerable control.  He has acquired a capital for his empire. He intends to preserve and improve it.In an honorable Muslim tradition, he plans a multicultural and tolerant city. The population is much reduced, after decades of fear and uncertainty, so Mehmed brings Greeks from the Aegean (soon another part of his domain) to revive the place. The Greek Orthodox patriarch is left in charge of his flock. And when the Jews in Spain are expelled, in 1492, many of them come to Istanbul where it is official policy to welcome them.Mehmed launches into a busy building program, founding several mosques and beginning Topkapi Sarayi in 1462 as his own palace. Constantinople, transformed into Istanbul, is set to be a great imperial center again. It has exchanged one empire for another, Byzantine for Ottoman.Suleiman the MagnificentSuleimanthe Magnificentdeveloped the power of the Ottomans to its greatest extent, he captured Belgrade, subjugated Hungary, besieged Vienna (1529) and conquered parts of North Africa. During the sixteenth century the Ottoman fleet made them masters of the Mediterranean.The conquered territories were divided into military fiefs. The sultan began the practice of exacting an annual tribute of Christian children to provide a loyal corps of palace soldiers. The Janissary, as the new troops were called, soon became the terror of Europe. But the very strength of the Turkish military organization led to internal weakness. The slave army, numbering up to 100,000 men, became a state within a state. To protect themselves from palace coups, the reigning sultan confined his brothers to celibacy in walled gardens. As a result, when later sultans were succeeded by a brother, the fledgling ruler was ignorant of his responsibility.The first signs of the empire's weakness became apparent during the Great Turkish War  (1683-99), which began with the second siege of  Vienna and ended with the transfer of most of Hungary from Ottoman to Austrian hands.Gradually, portions of the empire began to break away. By 1850,  Egypt and Arabia gained autonomy, and  Algeria was controlled by France. In the Balkans, Greece won independence in 1830. The Ottoman Empire which suffered a series of defeats by Austrian and  Russian armies, was reluctant to modernize its institutions because pious Moslems felt that the whole Islamic character of the state would be endangered.The Crimean War, where Ottomans were fighting together with French and British forces, ended with a victory over the Russians. Ironically, the victory cost the Turks more than earlier defeats at Russians hands had ever done because it became clear that the survival of the Ottoman empire depended on the support of one or another of the European Great powers.Britain and France had an interest to prevent the collapse of the Turkish empire because they considered it a block against the expansion of Russia or Austria into the Balkans. Until the 1870's Great Britain played the role of primary protector of the Sultan; later the Germans played the same role.Ismail I and the Safavids: 1501-1524After four centuries of dominance by powerful intruders (Seljuk Turks, Mongols), Persia acquires in the 16th century a new dynasty from the heartland of the classical Persian empire.Azerbaijan was the territory of the Medes, founders of Iran's first empire. Recently it has become the center of a Sufi sect, established by Sheikh Safi al-Din. His descendants, known from his name as the Safavids, govern the city of Ardabil as a small theocratic state. In the 15th century they develop a passionate commitment to the Shi'a version of Islam (the family claims descent from one of the twelve Shi'a imams - see The Shi'as). The characteristics of Iran in the late 20th century have their roots in Azerbaijan 500 years ago.One of the sheikh's descendants, Ismail, drastically enlarges the family's power in the early 16th century. At the age of fourteen he leads the local tribes in the capture of Tabriz, where he is enthroned in 1501 as the shah of Azerbaijan. (Ismail is not alone in teenage achievements of this kind; four years previously Babur, also aged fourteen, briefly captures Samarkand.)Ismail extends his control over much of Mesopotamia and Persia, using the Shi'a faith as a rallying cry. By the end of his reign Shi'ism, a minority sect within Islam, has become the faith of the majority of Persians. In this process conversion and compulsion often go together. But a newly defined nation is now able to identify its enemies as the Sunnis.Sunnis are pressing against Persia from both west and east, but the more immediate threat is from the east. Uzbek tribes, under the leadership of Shaibani Khan, are moving southwest from Samarkand and Bukhara. By 1507 Shaibani has reached Herat, which he captures in that year.Ismail confronts the Uzbeks at Merv in 1510 and wins a resounding victory. Shaibani is taken and killed (his skull, set in gold, becomes one of Ismail's favorite drinking cups). Another Sunni ruler to the east of Persia is Babur, now established in Kabul. But Babur has no aggressive intentions against Persia. Ismail contents himself with diplomatic efforts to convert him to the Shi'a faith.The real Sunni threat now comes from the Ottoman Turks. Recent military successes have secured the western boundary of their empire, in the Balkans. Now they find they have a strong and aggressive neighbor in Persia, heretical in his religious beliefs and with his power base (Azerbaijan) and his capital (Tabriz) close to their own regions of Anatolia.A clash is inevitable. It occurs at Çhaldiran in 1514. Ismail is defeated; his tribesmen are no match for the highly trained janissaries, and unlike the Turks he has no artillery. But this encounter between Ottoman and Persian is only the beginning of a long struggle, in which Persian fortunes in the east are intimately linked to those of the Balkans in the west.Abbas I: 1587-1629When Shah Abbas begins his reign in 1587, at the age of sixteen, he is confronted by exactly the problem which his great-grandfather Ismail I faced eighty years previously. Ottoman Turks are pressing in from the northwest at the same time as Uzbeks from the northeast.The young shah's solution is to make a disadvantageous treaty with the Turks, in 1590, surrendering valuable territory but leaving himself free to confront the Uzbeks. But first he undertakes a reorganization of the Persian army, replacing a feudal system of tribal levies with professional troops paid from the imperial treasury.The military reforms benefit from Persia's experience against the better trained and better equipped Turks, and also - rather oddly - from the practical advice of an Englishman, Sir Robert Shirley, who arrives as a member of an English embassy in 1599 and stays in Persia for eight years.The resulting army has three specialist regiments - cavalry, musketeers and artillerymen. Their successes enable Shah Abbas to extend the Persian Empire as far as Kandahar in the east, while in the west recovering Mesopotamia and the regions ceded to the Turks in the treaty of 1590.The proximity of the Turks has made Tabriz, the original base of the Safavid dynasty, dangerously insecure. In 1548 the capital has already been moved southeast to Kazvin by Tahmasp I, son of Ismail I.Shah Abbas goes further in the same direction when he moves the capital in 1598 to Isfahan. Here he creates, during the remaining 30 years of his life, a splendid city of elegant domes. Isfahan comes to symbolize the Persian style in the same way as the Shi'a doctrine, introduced by Abbas's great-grandfather, becomes part of the nation's identity. This region has had 2500 years of richly varied history, but modern Iran is essentially a Safavid creation.Isfahan: 17th centuryIsfahan is already a city of ancient history and considerable wealth when Shah Abbas decides, in 1598, to turn it into a magnificent capital. It has a Masjid-i-Jami, or Friday Mosque, dating from the Seljuk period (11th-12th century), still surviving today and noted for its fine patterned brickwork. And it has a thriving school of craftsmen skilled in the making of polychrome ceramic tiles.Shah Abbas favors in architecture what comes to seem almost the theme of his city - gently curving domes covered in a glorious array of Isfahan's colored tiles.The new center of the city is a vast rectangular space, the Maidan-i-Shah (Royal Parade), designed for parades and polo. At its southern end there rises the most magnificent of Isfahan's swelling blue domes, on the Masjid-i-Shah (Royal Mosque). The tiles are shaped where necessary to fit the curve of the dome, as are those which clad the mosque's circular minarets. The dome is reflected in a great pool in the courtyard.On the east of the Maidan-i-Shah is a smaller blue dome, on the Mosque of Sheikh Lutfullah - built by Shah Abbas in honor of his father-in-law and used as his private chapel. There are other glorious buildings in Isfahan, but these domes have become the trademark of Persian Islamic architecture.Pampered heirs: 17th centuryIn both Turkey and Persia a major change is made in royal protocol during the first half of the 17th century. The development is the same in each place, and it has a profound effect on future sultans and shahs.In Turkey it has been an official policy of state for each new sultan, on achieving power, to kill his brothers and nephews. Without a system of primogeniture, the crown goes to the strongest among the candidates within the ruling family. Once a winner has emerged, this drastic measure is a way of ensuring an untroubled reign. The sultan Mehmed III, winning power in 1595, murders his unusually large family of nineteen brothers.In Persia this principle of violence is not enshrined in law, but in practice the result is similarly brutal. Shah Abbas, ruling in the early 17th century, blinds and imprisons his deposed father, his two brothers and one of his sons.Shah Abbas in Persia and his contemporary, Ahmed I, in Turkey independently put in place a more merciful system. Abbas decrees that in future all royal princes will live in the harem, out of harm's way, until such time as the ruling shah dies. Ahmed's solution in Turkey is similar, but each prince here is to have a pavilion of his own in a walled garden (the merciful Ahmed was five, in 1595, when his father killed his nineteen uncles).The result is the same in both empires. Less royal blood is shed but the standard of leadership declines. Sultans and shahs, previously on the battlefield from their teens, learning the harsh ways of the world, now emerge in a state of sheltered ignorance to take up the responsibilities of power. The politics of the harem impinge upon, and sometimes even replace in importance, the politics of the real world (see Harems and Eunuchs).In Persia the Safavids retain the throne for a century after this change. In Turkey the royal line survives three times as long, to the end of the Ottoman Empire. But the heyday of each dynasty has passed.Decline of the Safavids: 1722-1736The first major threat to the enfeebled Safavid dynasty comes in 1722 when Afghan rebels march west and capture Isfahan. This disaster is soon followed by the simultaneous invasion of Persia by Russia and Turkey. Each is determined to prevent the other gaining an advantage in this strategic region, but in 1724 they agree to divide the spoils. Both remain in possession of part of the Persian Empire.The shah is briefly saved from this unwelcome situation by Nadir Quli Beg, leader of a gang of tribal brigands. By birth a Turk, from the Meshed region, he brings 5000 men to the support of the shah in 1726.The brigand proves a brilliant general. Transforming the Persian army, he leads a disciplined body of men to victory over the Afghan rebels holding Isfahan. He then drives the Turks out of the western regions of Persia. And by the mere threat of war he persuades the Russians to relinquish the territories they have seized.But brigands acquiring this much power are not easily controlled. In 1736 Nadir Quli Beg deposes the last Safavid shah and takes the throne for himself, changing his name to Nadir Shah.Nadir Shah: 1736-1747Nadir Shah, in a reign of eleven years, devotes himself to conquest with the single-minded determination of Timur, the last great conqueror to sweep through these regions.First, after a long siege in 1736, he recovers Kandahar - the stronghold of the Afghan chieftains who have until recently been in possession of Isfahan. With Afghanistan safely back under imperial control, Nadir Shah is next tempted further east (like Timur before him) into the fabulously wealthy empire of India. The Moghul dynasty, possessing probably a greater number of precious stones than any other ruling family in the world, is itself in a feeble state. A visit to Delhi is irresistible - as is Nadir Shah himself.In December 1738 Nadir Shah crosses the Indus at Attock. Two months later he defeats the army of the Moghul emperor, Mohammed Shah. In March he enters Delhi. The conqueror has iron control over his troops and at first the city is calm. It is broken when an argument between citizens and some Persian soldiers escalates into a riot in which 900 Persians are killed. Even now Nadir Shah forbids reprisals until he has inspected the scene. But when he rides through the city, stones are thrown at him. Someone fires a musket which kills an officer close to the shah.In reprisal he orders a massacre. The killing lasts for a day. The number of the dead is more than 30,000.Amazingly, when the Moghul emperor begs for mercy for his people, the Persian conqueror is able to grant it. The killing stops, for the collection of Delhi's valuables to begin.Untold wealth travels west with the Persians. The booty includes the two most spectacular possessions of the Moghul emperors - the Peacock Throne, commissioned by Shah Jahan, and the Koh-i-Nur diamond. Nadir Shah is able to send a decree home from Delhi remitting all taxes in Persia for three years. In addition to the jewels and the gold, he takes with him 1000 elephants, 100 masons and 200 carpenters. The parallel with the visit of Timur, 341 years previously, is almost exact.But Timur was at least creating a capital city at Samarkand. Nadir Shah has little interest in any activity other than conquest. He takes Bukhara in 1740 and continues to campaign (though with diminishing success and increasing ferocity) until his death in 1747, stabbed in his tent by an assassin.Nadir Shah's achievement has been to reassemble by conquest the Persian Empire. After his death it rapidly falls apart again. The eastern part now begins its separate existence as Afghanistan. The west enjoys a rare period of peace under a leader of the Zand tribe, Karim Khan, who rules from 1757 to 1794 with his capital at Shiraz. He is followed by the last of Persia's lengthy dynasties, the Qajars.Mughal Empire in IndiaBabur in Kabul: 1504-1525Babur, founder of the Mughul dynasty in India, is one of history's more endearing conquerors. In his youth he is one among many impoverished princes, all descended from Timur, who fight among themselves for possession of some small part of the great man's fragmented empire. Babur even captures Samarkand itself on three separate occasions, each for only a few months. The first time he achieves this he is only fourteen.What distinguishes Babur from other brawling princes is that he is a keen observer of life and keeps a diary. In it he vividly describes his triumphs and sorrows, whether riding out with friends at night to attack a walled village or mooning around for the unrequited love of a beautiful boy.Babur's 'throneless times', as he later describes these early years, come to an end in 1504 when he captures Kabul. Here, at the age of twenty-one, he is able to establish a settled court and to enjoy the delights of gardening, art and architecture in the Timurid tradition of his family.With a powerful new Persian dynasty to the west (under Ismail I) and an aggressive Uzbek presence to the north (under Shaibani Khan), Babur's Kabul becomes the main surviving center of the Timurid tradition. But these same pressures mean that his only chance of expanding is eastwards - into India.Babur feels that he has an inherited claim upon northern India, deriving from Timur's capture of Delhi in 1398, and he makes several profitable raids through the mountain passes into the Punjab. But his first serious expedition is launched in October 1525.Some forty years later (but not sooner than that) it is evident that Babur's descendants are a new and established dynasty in northern India. Babur thinks of himself as a Turk, but he is descended from Genghis Khan as well as from Timur. The Persians refer to his dynasty as Mughal, meaning Mongol. And it is as the Moghul emperors of India that they become known to history.Babur in India: 1526-1530By the early 16th century the Muslim sultans of Delhi (an Afghan dynasty known as Lodi) are much weakened by threats from rebel Muslim principalities and from a Hindu coalition of Rajput rulers. When Babur leads an army through the mountain passes, from his stronghold at Kabul, he at first meets little opposition in the plains of north India.The decisive battle against Ibrahim, the Lodi sultan, comes on the plain of Panipat in April 1526. Babur is heavily outnumbered (with perhaps 25,000 troops in the field against 100,000 men and 1000 elephants), but his tactics win the day.Babur digs into a prepared position, copied (he says) from the Turks - from whom the use of guns has spread to the Persians and now to Babur. As yet the Indians of Delhi have no artillery or muskets. Babur has only a few, but he uses them to great advantage. He collects 700 carts to form a barricade (a device pioneered by the Hussites of Bohemia a century earlier).Sheltered behind the carts, Babur's gunners can go through the laborious business of firing their matchlocks - but only at an enemy charging their position. It takes Babur some days to tempt the Indians into doing this. When they do so, they succumb to slow gunfire from the front and to a hail of arrows from Babur's cavalry charging on each flank.Victory at Panipat brings Babur the cities of Delhi and Agra, with much booty in treasure and jewels. But he faces a stronger challenge from the Confederation of Rajputs who had themselves been on the verge of attacking Ibrahim Lodi.The armies meet at Khanua in March 1527 and again, using similar tactics, Babur wins. For the next three years, Babur roams around with his army, extending his territory to cover most of north India - and all the while recording in his diary his fascination with this exotic world which he has conquered.Humayun: 1530-1556Babur's control is still superficial when he dies in 1530, after just three years in India. His son Humayun keeps a tentative hold on the family's new possessions. But in 1543 he is driven west into Afghanistan by a forceful Muslim rebel, Sher Shah.Twelve years later, renewed civil war within India gives Humayun a chance to slip back almost unopposed. One victory, at Sirhind in 1555, is enough to recover him his throne. But six months later Humayun is killed in an accidental fall down a stone staircase. His 13-year-old son Akbar, inheriting in 1556, would seem to have little chance of holding on to India. Yet it is he who establishes the mighty Moghul Empire.Akbar: 1556-1605In the early years of Akbar's reign, his fragile inheritance is skilfully held together by an able chief minister, Bairam Khan. But from 1561 the 19-year-old emperor is very much his own man. An early act demonstrates that he intends to rule the two religious communities of India, Muslim and Hindu, in a new way - by consensus and cooperation, rather than alienation of the Hindu majority.In 1562 he marries a Rajput princess, daughter of the Raja of Amber (now Jaipur). She becomes one of his senior wives and the mother of his heir, Jahangir. Her male relations in Amber join Akbar's council and merge their armies with his.This policy is very far from conventional Muslim hostility to worshippers of idols. And Akbar carries it further, down to a level affecting every Hindu. In 1563 he abolishes a tax levied on pilgrims to Hindu shrines. In 1564 he puts an end to a much more hallowed source of revenue - the jizya, or annual tax on unbelievers which the Qur'an stipulates shall be levied in return for Muslim protection.At the same time Akbar steadily extends the boundaries of the territory which he has inherited.Akbar's normal way of life is to move around with a large army, holding court in a splendid camp laid out like a capital city but composed entirely of tents. His biographer, Abul Fazl, describes this royal progress as being 'for political reasons, and for subduing oppressors, under the veil of indulging in hunting'.A great deal of hunting does occur (a favorite version uses trained cheetahs to pursue deer) while the underlying political purpose - of warfare, treaties, marriages - is carried on.Warfare brings its own booty. Signing a treaty with Akbar, or presenting a wife to his harem (his collection eventually numbers about 300), involves a contribution to the exchequer. As his realm increases, so does his revenue. And Akbar proves himself an inspired administrator.The empire's growing number of provinces are governed by officials appointed only for a limited term, thus avoiding the emergence of regional warlords. And steps are taken to ensure that the tax on peasants varies with local circumstances, instead of a fixed proportion of their produce being automatically levied.At the end of Akbar's reign of nearly half a century, his empire is larger than any in India since the time of Asoka. Its outer limits are Kandahar in the west, Kashmir in the north, Bengal in the east and in the south a line across the subcontinent at the level of Aurangabad. Yet this ruler who achieves so much is illiterate. An idle schoolboy, Akbar finds in later life no need for reading. He prefers to listen to the arguments before taking his decisions (perhaps a factor in his skill as a leader).Akbar is original, quirky, willful. His complex character is vividly suggested in the strange palace which he builds, and almost immediately abandons, at Fatehpur Sikri.Fatehpur Sikri: 1571-1585In 1571 Akbar decides to build a new palace and town at Sikri, close to the shrine of a Sufi saint who has impressed him by foretelling the birth of three sons. When two boys have duly appeared, Akbar's masons start work on what is to be called Fatehpur ('Victory') Sikri. A third boy is born in 1572.Akbar's palace, typically, is unlike anyone else's. It resembles a small town, made up of courtyards and exotic free-standing buildings. They are built in a linear Hindu style, instead of the gentler curves of Islam. Beams and lintels and even floorboards are cut from red sandstone and are elaborately carved, much as if the material were oak rather than stone.The palace and mosque occupy the hill top, while a sprawling town develops below. The site is only used for some fourteen years, partly because Akbar has overlooked problems of water supply. Yet this is where his many and varied interests are given practical expression.Here Akbar employs translators to turn Hindu classics into Persian, scribes to produce a library of exquisite manuscripts, artists to illustrate them (the illiterate emperor loves to be read to and takes a keen interest in painting). Here there is a department of history under Abul Fazl; an order is sent out that anyone with personal knowledge of Babur and Humayun is to be interviewed so that valuable information is not lost.The building most characteristic of Akbar in Fatehpur Sikri is his famous diwan-i-khas, or hall of private audience. It consists of a single very high room, furnished only with a central pillar. The top of the pillar, on which Akbar sits, is joined by four narrow bridges to a balcony running round the wall. On the balcony are those having an audience with the emperor.If required, someone can cross one of the bridges - in a respectfully crouched position - to join Akbar in the center. Meanwhile, on the floor below, courtiers not involved in the discussion can listen unseen.In the diwan-i-khas Akbar deals mainly with affairs of state. To satisfy another personal interest, in comparative religion, he builds a special ibabat-khana ('house of worship'). Here he listens to arguments between Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zorastrians, Jews and Christians. The ferocity with which they all attack each other prompts him to devise a generalized religion of his own (in which a certain aura of divinity rubs off on himself).The Christians involved in these debates are three Jesuits who arrive from Goa in 1580. As the first Europeans at the Moghul court, they are a portent for the future.Jahangir: 1605-1627Akbar is succeeded in 1605 by his eldest and only surviving son, Jahangir. Two other sons have died of drink, and Jahangir's effectiveness as a ruler is limited by his own addiction to both alcohol and opium. But the empire is now stable enough for him to preside over it for twenty-two years without much danger of upheaval.Instead, he is able to indulge his curiosity about the natural world (which he records in a diary as vivid as that of his great-grandfather Babur) and his love of painting. Under his keen eye the imperial studio brings the Moghul miniature to a peak of perfection, maintained also during the reign of his son Shah Jahan.Moghul miniatures: 16th - 17th centuryWhen Humayun wins his way back into India, in 1555, he brings with him two Persian artists from the school of Bihzad. Humayun and the young Akbar take lessons in drawing. Professional Indian artists learn too from these Persian masters.From this blend of traditions there emerges the very distinctive Moghul school of painting. Full-bodied and realistic compared to the more fanciful and decorative Persian school, it develops in the workshops which Akbar establishes in the 1570s at Fatehpur Sikri.Akbar puts his artists to work illustrating the manuscripts written out by scribes for his library. New work is brought to the emperor at the end of each week. He makes his criticisms and distributes rewards to those who meet with his approval.Detailed scenes are what Akbar likes, showing court celebrations, gardens being laid out, cheetahs released for the hunt, forts being stormed and endless battles. The resulting images are a treasure trove of historical detail. But as paintings they are slightly busy.Akbar's son Jahangir takes a special interest in painting, and his requirements differ from his father's. He is more likely to want an accurate depiction of a bird which has caught his interest, or a political portrait showing himself with a rival potentate. In either case, the image requires clarity and conviction as well as finely detailed realism.The artists rise superbly to this challenge. In Jahangir's reign, and that of his son Shah Jahan, the Moghul imperial studio produces work of exceptional beauty. In Shah Jahan's time even the crowded narrative scenes, so popular with Akbar, are peopled by finely observed and convincing characters.Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb: 1627-1707During the reigns of Shah Jahan and his son Aurangzeb, the policy of religious toleration introduced by Akbar is gradually abandoned. It has been largely followed by Shah Jahan's father, Jahangir - though at the very start of his reign he provides the Sikhs with their first martyr when the guru Arjan is arrested, in 1606, and dies under torture.In 1632 Shah Jahan signals an abrupt return to a stricter interpretation of Islam when he orders that all recently built Hindu temples shall be destroyed. A Muslim tradition states that unbelievers may keep the shrines which they have when Islam arrives, but not add to their number.Direct provocation of this kind is untypical of Shah Jahan, but it becomes standard policy during the reign of his son Aurangzeb. His determination to impose strict Islamic rule on India undoes much of what was achieved by Akbar. An attack on Rajput territories in 1679 makes enemies of the Hindu princes; the reimposition of the jizya in the same year ensures resentment among Hindu merchants and peasants.At the same time Aurangzeb is obsessed with extending Moghul rule into the difficult terrain of southern India. He leaves the empire larger but weaker than he finds it. In his eighties, he is still engaged in permanent and futile warfare to hold what he has seized.In the decades after the death of Aurangzeb, in 1707, the Moghul empire fragments into numerous semi-independent territories - seized by local officials or landowners whose descendants become the rajas and nawabs of more recent times. Moghul emperors continue to rule in the name for another century and more, but their prestige is hollow.Real power has declined gradually and imperceptibly throughout the 17th century, ever since the expansive days of Akbar's empire. Yet it is in the 17th century that news of the wealth, splendor, architectural brilliance and dynastic violence of the Moghul dynasty first impresses the rest of the world.Europeans become a significant presence in India for the first time during the 17th century. They take home descriptions of the ruler's fabulous wealth, causing him to become known as the Great Moghul. They have a touching tale to tell of Shah Jahan's love for his wife and of the extraordinary building, the Taj Mahal, which he provides for her tomb.And as Shah Jahan's reign merges into Aurangzeb's, they can astonish their hearers with an oriental melodrama of a kind more often associated with Turkey, telling of how Aurangzeb kills two of his brothers and imprisons his ageing father, Shah Jahan, in the Red Fort at Agra - with the Taj Mahal in his view across the Jumna, from the marble pavilions of his castle prison.Moghul domes: 1564-1674The paintings commissioned by the Moghul emperors are superb, but it is their architecture which has most astonished the world - and in particular the white marble domes characteristic of the reign of Shah Jahan.There is a long tradition of large Muslim domes in central Asia, going as far back as a tomb in Bukhara in the 10th century. But the Moghuls develop a style which is very much their own - allowing the dome to rise from the building in a swelling curve which somehow implies lightness, especially when the material of the dome is white marble.The first dome of this kind surmounts the tomb of Humayun in Delhi, built between 1564 and 1573. The style is then overlooked for a while - no doubt because of Akbar's preference for Hindu architecture, as in Fatehpur Sikri - until Shah Jahan, the greatest builder of the dynasty develops it in the 17th century with vigor and sophistication.His first attempt in this line is also his masterpiece - a building which has become the most famous in the world, for its beauty and for the romantic story behind its creation.Throughout his early career, much of it spent in rebellion against his father, Shah Jahan's greatest support has been his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. But four years after he succeeds to the throne this much-loved companion dies, in 1631, giving birth to their fourteenth child. The Taj Mahal, her tomb in Agra, is the expression of Shah Jahan's grief. Such romantic gestures are rare among monarchs, and certainly, none has ever achieved its commemorative purpose so brilliantly.There is no known architect for the Taj. It seems probable that Shah Jahan himself takes a leading role in directing his masons - particularly since his numerous other buildings evolve within a related style.The Taj Mahal is built between 1632 and 1643. In 1644 the emperor commissions the vast Friday Mosque for his new city in Delhi. In 1646 he begins the more intimate Pearl Mosque in the Red Fort in Agra. Meanwhile, he is building a new Red Fort in Delhi, with white marble pavilions for his own lodgings above massive red sandstone walls. At Fatehpur Sikri he provides a new shrine for the Sufi saint to whom his grandfather, Akbar, was so devoted.All these buildings contain variations on the theme of white and subtly curving domes, though none can rival Shah Jahan's first great example in the Taj.Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan's son, does not inherit his father's passionate interest in architecture. But he commissions two admirable buildings in the same tradition. One is the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, begun in 1673; even larger than his father's Friday Mosque in Delhi, it rivals it in the beauty of its domes. The other, beginning in 1662, goes to the other extreme; the tiny Pearl Mosque in the Red Fort in Delhi, begun in 1662 for Aurangzeb's private worship, is a small miracle of white marble.It is these marble highlights which catch the eye. But the Red Forts containing the two Pearl Mosques are themselves extraordinary examples of 17th-century castles.The Moghuls after Aurangzeb: 18th centuryWhen the Moghul emperor Aurangzeb is in his eighties, and the empire in disarray, an Italian living in India (Niccolao Manucci) Predicts appalling bloodshed on the old man's death, worse even than that which disfigured the start of Aurangzeb's reign. The Italian is right. In the war of succession which begins in 1707, two of Aurangzeb's sons and three of his grandsons are killed.Violence and disruption is the pattern of the future. The first six Moghul emperors have ruled for a span of nearly 200 years. In the 58 years after Aurangzeb's death, there are eight emperors - four of whom are murdered and one deposed.This degree of chaos has a disastrous effect on the empire built up by Akbar. The stability of Moghul India depends on the loyalty of those ruling its many regions. Some are administered on the emperor's behalf by governors, who are members of the military hierarchy. Others are ruled by princely families, who through treaty or marriage have become allies of the emperor.In the 18th century rulers of each kind continue to profess loyalty to the Moghul emperor in Delhi, but in practice they behave with increasing independence. The empire fragments into the many small principalities whose existence will greatly help the British in India to gain control, by playing rival neighbors off against each other.In the short term, though, there is a more immediate danger. During the 1730s a conqueror in the classic mold of Genghis Khan or Timur emerges in Persia. He seizes the Persian throne in 1736, taking the title Nadir Shah.Later that year he captures the stronghold of Kandahar. The next major fortress on the route east, that of Kabul, is still in Moghul hands - a treasured possession since the time of Babur. Nadir Shah takes it in 1738, giving him control of the territory up to the Khyber Pass. Beyond the Khyber lies the fabulous wealth of India. Like Genghis Khan in 1221 and Timur in 1398, Nadir Shah moves on.In December 1738 Nadir Shah crosses the Indus at Attock. Two months later he defeats the army of the Moghul emperor, Mohammed Shah. In March he enters Delhi. The conqueror has iron control over his troops and at first the city is calm. It is broken when an argument between citizens and some Persian soldiers escalates into a riot in which 900 Persians are killed. Even now Nadir Shah forbids reprisals until he has inspected the scene. But when he rides through the city, stones are thrown at him. Someone fires a musket which kills an officer close to the shah.In reprisal, he orders a massacre. The killing lasts for a day. The number of the dead is more than 30,000.Amazingly, when the Moghul emperor begs for mercy for his people, the Persian conqueror is able to grant it. The killing stops, for the collection of Delhi's valuables to begin.Untold wealth travels west with the Persians. The booty includes the two most spectacular possessions of the Moghul emperors - the Peacock Throne, commissioned by Shah Jahan, and the Koh-i-Nur diamond. Nadir Shah is able to send a decree home from Delhi remitting all taxes in Persia for three years. In addition to the jewels and the gold, he takes with him 1000 elephants, 100 masons and 200 carpenters. The parallel with the visit of Timur, 341 years previously, is almost exact.Video AssignmentInteractive Notebook AssignmentsDraw or outline a map of the Eurasian landmass.

They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco, and had their center in the city of La Venta.The Olmec flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BCE to about 400 BCE. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500 BCE, but by 1600–1500 BCE, Early Olmec culture had emerged. They were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.The Olmec heartland is the area in the Gulf of Mexico's lowlands and is generally considered the birthplace of the Olmec culture. This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The Tuxtlas Mountains rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's Bay of Campeche. Here the Olmec constructed permanent city-temple complexes at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and Laguna de los Cerros.Religion[Figure 1]Olmec King Surviving art, like this relief of a king or chief found in La Venta, help provide clues about how Olmec society functioned.Unfortunately, there is no surviving direct account of Olmec beliefs, but their notable artwork provide clues about their life and religion. There were eight different androgynous Olmec deities, each with its own distinct characteristics. For example, the Bird Monster was depicted as a harpy eagle associated with rulership while the Olmec Dragon was shown with flame eyebrows, a bulbous nose, andbifurcatedtongue. These gods were believed to provide the rulers a mandate to lead.Trade and Village LifeThe Olmec were not economically confined by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, Olmec artifacts have been found across Mesoamerica, indicating that there were extensive inter-regional trade routes. The Olmec period saw a significant increase in the length of trade routes, the variety of goods, and the sources of traded items.Trading helped the Olmec build their urban centers of San Lorenzo and La Venta. However, these cities were used predominantly for ceremonial purposes; most people lived in villages. Individual homes had a lean-to and a storage pit nearby. They also likely had gardens in which the Olmec would grow medicinal herbs and small crops like sunflowers. Most agriculture took place outside of the villages in fields cleared using slash-and-burn techniques. The Olmec likely grew crops like maize, beans, squash, manioc, sweet potatoes, and cotton.ArtThe Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture. Wrought in a large number of media – jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others – much Olmec art, such as The Wrestler, is surprisingly naturalistic. Other art expresses fantastic anthropomorphic creatures, often highly stylized, using an iconography reflective of a religious meaning. Common motifs include downturned mouths and a cleft head, both of which are seen in representations of were-jaguars.The Olmec colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BCE and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. All portray mature men with fleshy cheeks, flat noses, and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. The backs of the monuments often are flat. The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances, requiring a great deal of human effort and resources, it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers. Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear.The discovery of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.[Figure 2]Olmec Head This sculpture is typical of the Colossal Heads of the OlmecThe End of the OlmecsThe Olmec population declined sharply between 400 and 350 BCE, though it is unclear why. Archaeologists speculate that the depopulation was caused by environmental changes, specifically riverine environment changes. These changes may have been triggered by the silting up of rivers due to agricultural practices.Another theory for the considerable population drop relates to tectonic upheavals or subsidence, as suggested by Santley and colleagues who propose relocation of settlements due to volcanism, instead of extinction. Volcanic eruptions during the Early, Late and Terminal Formative periods would have blanketed the lands and forced the Olmec to move their settlements.The ZapotecasThe Zapotec civilization originated in the three Central Valleys of Oaxaca in the late sixth Century BCE. The valleys were divided between three different-sized societies, separated by no-man's-land in the middle, today occupied by the city of Oaxaca. Archaeological evidence from the period, such as burned temples and sacrificed captives, suggest that the three societies competed against each other.[Figure 3]Panorama from Monte Alban The view from the site of origin of the ZapotecPhasesThe Zapotec state formed at Monte Albán began an expansion during the late Monte Alban 1 phase (400–100 BCE) and throughout the Monte Alban 2 phase (100 BCE – 200 CE). Zapotec rulers seized control over the provinces outside the valley of Oaxaca. They were able to do this during Monte Alban 1c (roughly 200 BCE) to Monte Alban 2 (200 BCE – 100 CE) because none of the surrounding provinces could compete with the valley of Oaxaca both politically and militarily. By 200 CE, the Zapotecs had extended their influence, from Quiotepec in the North to Ocelotepec and Chiltepec in the South. Monte Albán had become the largest city in what are today the southern Mexican highlands, and retained this status until approximately 700 CE.Expansion and DeclineThe expansion of the Zapotec empire peaked during the Monte Alban II phase. Zapotecs conquered or colonized settlements far beyond The Valley of Oaxaca. Between Monte Alban phases 1 and 2 there was a considerable expansion of the population of the Valley of Oaxaca.  As the population grew, so did the degree of social differentiation, the centralization of political power, and ceremonial activity. During Monte Alban 1-2 valley appears to have been fragmented into several independent states, as manifested in regional centers of power.The Zapotecs were ultimately destroyed by Spanish invaders. Having lost militarily to the Aztecs in battles from 1497-1502, the Zapotecs tried to avoid confrontation with the Spaniards. The Spaniards took advantage of this and ultimately defeated the Zapotecs after five years of campaigns ending in 1527. There were some subsequent uprisings against the new rulers, but for all intents and purposes, the Zapotecs were conquered.Zapotec SocietyThe Zapotecs developed a calendar and a logosyllabic system of writing that used a separate glyph to represent each of the syllables of the language. This writing system is thought to be one of the first writing systems of Mesoamerica and a predecessor of the those developed by theMaya, Mixtec, and Aztec civilizations.Like most Mesoamerican religious systems, the Zapotec religion was polytheistic. Two principal deities include Cocijo, the rain god (similar to the Aztec god Tlaloc), and Coquihani, the god of light.According to historic as well as contemporary Zapotec legends, their ancestors emerged from the earth, from caves, or turned into people from trees or jaguars. Their governing elite apparently believed that they descended from supernatural beings that lived among the clouds, and that upon death they would return to such status. In fact, the name by which Zapotecs are known today results from this belief. The Zapotecs of the Central Valleys call themselves ""Be'ena' Za'a""--The Cloud People.MitlaMitla is the second most important archeological site in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico, and the most important of the Zapotec culture.The site is located 44 km from the city of Oaxaca. While Monte Albán was most important as the political center, Mitla was the main religious center. The name Mitla is derived from the Nahuatl name Mictlán, which was the place of the dead or underworld. Its Zapotec name is Lyobaa, which means ""place of rest. "" The name Mictlán was Hispanicized to Mitla by the Spanish. However, what makes Mitla unique among Mesoamerican sites is the elaborate and intricate mosaic fretwork and geometric designs that cover tombs, panels, friezes and even entire walls. These mosaics are made with small, finely cut and polished stone pieces which have been fitted together without the use of mortar. No other site in Mexico has this.TeotihuacanJust 30 miles from modern day Mexico City lies the precolumbian Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan. It is famous for its pyramids and series of accompanying residential compounds, but was once much more than an archaeological and tourist site. Archaeological evidence suggests that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic city, with distinct quarters occupied by Otomi, Zapotec, Mixtec, Maya, and Nahua peoples. In 2001, Terrence Kaufman presented linguistic evidence suggesting that an important ethnic group in Teotihuacan was of Totonacan or Mixe–Zoquean linguistic affiliation. Other scholars maintain that the largest population group must have been of Otomi ethnicity because the Otomi language is known to have been spoken in the area around Teotihuacan both before and after the classic period and not during the middle period.The city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about CE 250. The city may have lasted until sometime between the seventh and eighth centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE. At its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas, with a population estimated at 125,000 or more,making it at minimum the sixth largest city in the world during its epoch. Teotihuacan began as a new religious center in the Mexican Highland around the first century CE. This city came to be the largest and most populated center in the New World. Teotihuacan was even home to multi-floor apartment compounds built to accommodate this large population. The civilization and cultural complex associated with the site is also referred to as Teotihuacan or Teotihuacano.Although it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of a state empire, its influence throughout Mesoamerica is well documented; evidence of Teotihuacano presence can be seen at numerous sites in Veracruz and the Maya region. The Aztecs may have been influenced by this city. The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is also a subject of debate. Possible candidates are the Nahua, Otomi or Totonac ethnic groups. Scholars have also suggested that Teotihuacan was a multiethnic state.FoundingThe city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about CE 250. The city may have lasted until sometime between the seventh and eighth centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE.

Teotihuacan was even home to multi-floor apartment compounds built to accommodate this large population. The civilization and cultural complex associated with the site is also referred to as Teotihuacan or Teotihuacano. The founders of the city, however, are not known. Scholars have speculated that the Xitle volcano may have prompted a mass emigration out of the central valley and into the Teotihuacan valley. These settlers may have founded, or at least helped grow, the city.An alternate explanation is that the Totonac people, who still remain today, founded Teotihuacan. There is also evidence that at least some of the people living in Teotihuacan immigrated from those areas influenced by the Teotihuacano civilization, including the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Maya peoples.LayoutThe city's broad central avenue, called ""Avenue of the Dead"" (a translation from its Nahuatl name Miccoatli), is flanked by impressive ceremonial architecture, including the immense Pyramid of the Sun (third largest in the World after the Great Pyramid of Cholula and the Great Pyramid of Giza). Along the Avenue of the Dead are many smaller talud-tablero platforms. The Aztecs believed they were tombs, inspiring the name of the avenue. Further down the Avenue of the Dead is the area known as the Citadel, containing the ruined Temple of the Feathered Serpent. This area was a large plaza surrounded by temples that formed the religious and political center of the city. Most of the common people lived in large apartment buildings spread across the city. Many of the buildings contained workshops where artisans produced pottery and other goods.The geographical layout of Teotihuacan is a good example of the Mesoamerican tradition of planning cities, settlements, and buildings as a reflections of the view of the Universe. Its urban grid is aligned to precisely 15.5º east of North. One theory says this is due to the fact that the sun rose at that same angle during the same summer day each year. Settlers used the alignment to calibrate their sense of time or as a marker for planting crops or performing certain rituals. Another theory is that there are numerous ancient sites in Mesoamerica that seem to be oriented with the tallest mountain in their given area. This appears to be the case at Teotihuacan, although the mountain to which it is oriented is not visible from within the Teotihuacan complex due to a closer mountain ridge. Pecked-cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions indicate how the people managed to maintain the urban grid over long distances. It also enabled them to orient the Pyramids to the distant mountain that was out of sight.Mayan CivilizationThe pre-classic period is the first of three periods in Mayan history, coming before the classic and post-classic periods. It extends from the emergence of the first settlements sometime between 2000 and 1500 BCE until 250 CE. The Pre-classic Era saw the rise of large-scale ceremonial architecture, writing, cities, and states. Many of the distinctive elements of Mesoamerican civilization can be traced back to this period, including the dominance of corn, the building of pyramids, human sacrifice, jaguar-worship, the complex calendar, and many of the gods.The pre-classic period is further divided into four periods: early pre-classic, middle pre-classic, late pre-classic, terminal pre-classic.Early Pre-classic (2000 BCE–1000 BCE)Though the exact starting date of Mayan civilization is unclear, there were Mayan language speakers in the Southern Maya Area by 2000 BCE. It appears that around this time the Maya people began to transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a culture based around agricultural villages. The process appears to have been a gradual one. Analysis of bones from early Maya grave sites indicate that, although maize had already become a major component of the diet by this time, fish, meat from game animals, and other hunted or gathered foods still made up a major component of the diet. Along with the gradual development of agriculture, basic forms of pottery began to appear, with simple designs and some slipped vessels.Around this time, the Olmec culture began to emerge in nearby Tabasco, granting the early Maya an important trading partner and beginning a period of prolonged contact that would have profound effects on Maya society.[Figure 4]Southern Maya Area By 2000 BCE, there were speakers of Mayan languages in the Southern Maya AreaMiddle Pre-classic (1000 BCE–400 BCE)By around the year 1000 BCE, centuries of agricultural village life had begun to form the beginnings of a complex society: prestige goods such as obsidian mirrors and jade mosaics began to appear, increasing the demand for more extensive trade. Canals and irrigation schemes demanding coordinated human effort began to appear with increasing complexity and scale. Gradually, villages began to include central plazas and earthen mounds, occasionally enhanced by masonry. For instance, the site of La Blanca featured a central mound more than seventy-five feet tall and contained a masonry fragment strongly resembling a head in the distinctive Olmec style. Carved stone stele also began to appear during this period, adorned with portraits of rulers but still devoid of writing. Warfare appears to have intensified during this period, as evidenced by advanced weaponry, rulers beginning to be portrayed as warriors, and the appearance of mass graves and decapitated skeletons.Beginning around 900 BCE, the Pacific coastal region fell under the dominance of the La Blanca statelet, which collapsed around 600 BCE, to be replaced by a polity centered around the El Ujuxte site. Another early statelet was probably based at the site of Chalchuapa, a town with extensive earthen mounds arranged around several plazas. However, it was likely ruled by the first true Maya city-state, Kaminaljuyu. Lying within modern-day Guatemala City on the shores of Lake Miraflores, Kaminaljuyu developed a powerful government structure that organized massive irrigation campaigns and built numerous intricately carved stone monuments to its rulers. These monuments clearly depict war captives and often show the rulers holding weapons, indicating the Kaminaljuyu polity engaged in active warfare, dominating the Guatemalan highlands for centuries.During this period, the Olmec culture reached its zenith, centered around the capital of La Venta in modern-day Tabasco near the early Maya centers. Speakers of a Mixe–Zoquean language, the Olmec are generally recognized as the first true civilization in the Americas. Their capital city of La Venta contains extensive earthworks and stone monuments, including several of the distinctive Olmec stone heads. The Olmec share several features with later Maya culture, including extensive jaguar-worship, a diet dominated by maize, and the use of the cacao plant. Several words entered Mayan from a Mixe–Zoquean language, presumably due to Olmec influence. These words include the word ajaw, meaning ""lord,"" and kakaw, which has become the English words ""cacao"" and ""chocolate. "" Most of these borrowings relate to prestige concepts and high culture, indicating that the Middle Pre-classic Maya were deeply impressed and influenced by their northwestern neighbors.Late Pre-classic (400 BCE–100 CE)The Late Pre-classic saw the rise of two powerful states that rival later Classic Maya city-states for scale and monumental architecture, Kaminaljuyu in the highlands and El Mirador in the lowlands.Terminal Pre-classic (100 CE–250 CE)The late or terminal Pre-classic murals found in San Bartolo provide important information regarding mythology and royal inauguration ritual around 100 BCE.The story of the mysterious lost civilization that suddenly collapsed for an unknown reason has captured the popular imagination for well over a century. What is not as widely known is that there were actually two collapses, one at the end of the Preclassic and a more famous one at the end of the Classic. The Pre-classic collapse refers to the systematic decline and abandoning of the major Pre-classic cities such as Kaminaljuyu and El Mirador in around 100 CE. A number of theories have been proposed, but there is as little consensus as there is for the causes of the more famous collapse between the Classic and Post-classic periods.Classical Mayan CivilizationThe Classic period lasted from 250–900 CE. It was one of the peak of large-scale construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions. During this period the Maya population numbered in the millions. The Mayans developed an agriculturally intensive, city-centered civilization consisting of numerous independent city-states of varying power and influence. They created a multitude of kingdoms and small empires, built monumental palaces and temples, engaged in highly developed ceremonies, and developed an elaborate hieroglyphic writing system.The political, economic, and culturally dominant ‘core' Maya units of the Classic Maya world system were located in the central lowlands, while its corresponding peripheral Maya units were found along the margins of the southern highland and northern lowland areas. The semi-peripheral (mediational) units generally took the form of trade and commercial centers. But as in all world systems, the Maya core centers shifted through time, starting out during Pre-classic times in the southern highlands, moving to the central lowlands during the Classic period, and finally shifting to the northern peninsula during the Post-classic period.MonumentsThe most notable monuments are the stepped pyramids they built in their religious centers and the accompanying palaces of their rulers. The palace at Cancuén is the largest in the Maya area, but the site has no pyramids.[Figure 5]Tikal Temple Classic period temple from Tikal, Guatemala.Other important archaeological remains include the carved stone slabs usually called stelae (the Maya called them tetun, or ""tree-stones""), which depict rulers along with hieroglyphic texts describing their genealogy, military victories, and other accomplishments.[Figure 6]Mayan Mask Stucco frieze from Placeres, Campeche. Early Classic period (c. 250 - 600 CE.TradeThe political relationship between Classic Maya city-states has been likened to the relationships between city-states in Classical Greece and Renaissance Italy. Some cities were linked to each other by straight limestone causeways, known as sacbeob, although whether the exact function of these roads was commercial, political or religious has not been determined.The Maya civilization participated in long distance trade with many of the other Mesoamerican cultures, including Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, and other groups in central and gulf-coast Mexico. In addition, they had trade and exchanges with more distant, non-Mesoamerican groups, for example the Taínos of the Caribbean islands. Archeologists have found gold from Panama in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza. Important trade goods included cacao, salt, seashells, jade, and obsidian.DeclineThe Classic Maya Collapse refers to the decline of the Mayan Classic Period and abandonment of the Classic Period Maya cities of the southern Maya lowlands of Mesoamerica between the 8th and 9th centuries. This should not be confused with the collapse of the Preclassic Maya in the second century CE. The Classic Period of Mesoamerican chronology is generally defined as the period from 300 to 900 CE, the last 100 years of which, from 800 to 900 CE, are frequently referred to as the Terminal Classic.It has been hypothesized that the decline of the Maya is related to the collapse of their intricate trade systems, especially those connected to the central Mexican city of Teotihuacán. Preceding improved knowledge of the chronology of Mesoamerica, Teotihuacan was believed to have fallen during CE 700–750, forcing the ""restructuring of economic relations throughout highland Mesoamerica and the Gulf Coast"". This remaking of relationships between civilizations would have then given the collapse of the Classic Maya a slightly later date. However, after knowing more about the events and the time periods that they occurred, it is now believed that the strongest Teotihuacan influence was during the 4th and 5th centuries. In addition, the civilization of Teotihuacan started to lose its power, and maybe even abandoned the city, during CE 600–650. This differs greatly from the previous belief that Teotihuacano power decreased during CE 700–750. But since the new decline date of CE 600–650 has been accepted, the Maya civilizations are now thought to have lived on, and also prospered perhaps for another century and more than what was previously believed.The Classic Maya Collapse is one of the biggest mysteries in archaeology. The classic Maya urban centers of the southern lowlands, among them Palenque, Copán, Tikal, Calakmul and many others, went into decline during the 8th and 9th centuries and were abandoned shortly thereafter. Some 88 different theories or variations of theories attempting to explain the Classic Maya Collapse have been identified. From climate change to deforestation to lack of action by Mayan kings, there is no universally accepted collapse theory, although drought is gaining momentum as the leading explanation.Post-classical Mayan CivilizationThe period after the second collapse of the Maya empire (900 CE to 1600 CE) is called the post-classic period. Development in the northern centers persisted, characterized by an increasing diversity of external influences; the center of power shifted from the central lowlands to the northern peninsula in the post-classic period.The Maya cities of the northern lowlands in Yucatán continued to flourish; some of the important sites in this era were Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Edzná, and Coba. A typical Classic Maya polity was a small hierarchical state (ajawil, ajawlel, or ajawlil) headed by a hereditary ruler known as an ajaw (later k'uhul ajaw).Such kingdoms were usually no more than a capital city with its neighborhood and several lesser towns, although there were greater kingdoms, which controlled larger territories and extended patronage over smaller polities. Each kingdom had a name that did not necessarily correspond to any locality within its territory. Its identity was that of a political unit associated with a particular ruling dynasty. Interestingly, despite constant warfare and eventual shifts in regional power, most kingdoms never disappeared from the political landscape until the collapse of the whole system in the ninth century CE. In this respect, Classic Maya kingdoms are highly similar to late Post Classic polities encountered by the Spaniards in Yucatán and Central Mexico: some polities could be subordinated to hegemonic rulers through conquests or dynastic unions and yet even then they persisted as distinct entities.[Figure 7]El Castillo (pyramidd of Kukulcán) in Chichén Itzá Built by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization sometime between the 9th and 12th centuries CE, El Castillo served as a temple to the god Kukulkan, the Yucatec Maya Feathered Serpent deity closely related to the god Quetzalcoatl known to the Aztecs and other central Mexican cultures of the Postclassic period.Spanish sources invariably describe even the largest Maya settlements as dispersed collections of dwellings grouped around the temples and palaces of the ruling dynasty and lesser nobles. None of the Classic Maya cities shows evidence of economic specialization and commerce of the scale of Mexican Tenochtitlan. Instead, Maya cities could be seen as enormous royal households, the locales of the administrative and ritual activities of the royal court. They were the places where privileged nobles could approach the holy ruler, where aesthetic values of the high culture were formulated and disseminated and where aesthetic items were consumed. They were the self-proclaimed centers and the sources of social, moral, and cosmic order. The fall of a royal court as in the well-documented cases of Piedras Negras or Copan would cause the inevitable ""death"" of the associated settlement. After the decline of the ruling dynasties of Chichen and Uxmal, Mayapan ruled all of Yucatán until a revolt in 1450. (This city's name may be the source of the word ""Maya"", which had a more geographically restricted meaning in Yucatec and colonial Spanish and only grew to its current meaning in the 19th and 20th centuries). The area then degenerated into competing city-states until Yucatán was conquered by the Spanish.The Itza Maya, Ko'woj, and Yalain groups of Central Peten survived the collapse in the classic period in small numbers and by 1250 reconstituted themselves to form competing for city-states. The Itza maintained their capital at Tayasal (also known as Noh Petén), an archaeological site thought to underlay the modern city of Flores, Guatemala on Lake Petén Itzá. It ruled over an area extending across the Peten Lakes region, encompassing the community of Eckixil on Lake Quexil. The Ko'woj had their capital at Zacpeten. Post-classic Maya states also continued to survive in the southern highlands.[Figure 8]Trade routes and important cities Important sites and trade routes from the terminal classic and early-postclassic periods.The post-classic period is often viewed as a period of cultural decline. However, it was a time of technological advancement in areas of architecture, engineering, and weaponry. Metallurgy came into use for jewelry and some tools, with new alloys and techniques being developed in a few centuries. It appears that the wealthy pochteca (merchant class) and military orders became more powerful than was apparently the case in classic times. This afforded some degree of social mobility.The Colonial PeriodShortly after their first expeditions to the region in the 16th century, the Spanish initiated a number of attempts to subjugate the Maya who were hostile towards the Spanish crown and establish a colonial presence in the Maya territories of the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan highlands. This campaign, sometimes termed ""The Spanish Conquest of Yucatán"", would prove to be a lengthy and dangerous exercise for the conquistadores from the outset, and it would take some 170 years and tens of thousands of Indian auxiliaries before the Spanish established substantive control over all Maya lands. Unlike the Aztec andInca Empires, there was no single Maya political center that, once overthrown, would hasten the end of collective resistance from the indigenous peoples. Instead, the conquistador forces needed to subdue the numerous independent Maya polities almost one by one, many of which kept up fierce resistance. Most of the conquistadors were motivated by the prospects of the great wealth to be had from the seizure of precious metal resources such as gold or silver; however, the Maya lands themselves were poor in these resources. This would become another factor in forestalling Spanish designs of conquest, as they instead were initially attracted to the reports of great riches in central Mexico or Peru. The Spanish Church and government officials destroyed Maya texts and with them the knowledge of Maya writing, but by chance three of the pre-Columbian books dated to the post-classic period have been preserved. These are known as the Madrid Codex, The Dresden Codex, and the Paris Codex. The last Maya states, the Itza polity of Tayasal and the Ko'woj city of Zacpeten, were continuously occupied and remained independent of the Spanish until late in the 17th century. They were finally subdued by the Spanish in 1697.The ToltecsThe Toltec culture is an archaeological Mesoamerican culture that dominated a state centered in Tula, in the early post-classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (ca 800–1000 CE). Much of what is known about the Toltecs is based on what has been learned about the Aztecs, another Mesoamerican culture who postdated the Toltecs and admired the Toltecs as their predecessors. Since so much of what remains on record about the Toltecs may have been tainted by Aztec glorification and mythology, it is difficult to parse out the true history.The later Aztec culture saw the Toltecs as their intellectual and cultural predecessors and described Toltec culture emanating from Tōllān [ˈtoːlːaːn] (Nahuatl for Tula) as the epitome of civilization; indeed in the Nahuatl language the word ""Tōltēcatl"" [toːlˈteːkat͡] (singular) or ""Tōltēcah"" [toːlˈteːkaʔ] (plural) came to take on the meaning ""artisan."" The Aztec oral and pictographic tradition also described the history of the Toltec Empire, giving lists of rulers and their exploits. Among modern scholars, it is a matter of debate whether the Aztec narratives of Toltec history should be given credence as descriptions of actual historical events. While all scholars acknowledge that there is a large mythological part of the narrative, some maintain that by using a critical comparative method some level of historicity can be salvaged from the sources. Others maintain that continued analysis of the narratives as sources of actual history is futile and hinders access to actual knowledge of the culture. Other controversies relating to the Toltecs include how best to understand the reasons behind the perceived similarities in architecture and iconography between the archaeological site of Tula and the Mayan site of Chichén Itzá. No consensus has yet emerged about the degree or direction of influence between these two sites.HistoricistsThe historicists believe that there is truth within the stories told by the Aztecs. Désiré Charnay, the first archaeologist to work at Tula, Hidalgo, defended the historicist views based on his impression of the Toltec capital and was the first to note similarities in architectural styles between Tula and Chichén Itza, a famous archeological site. This led him to posit the theory that Chichén Itzá had been violently taken over by a Toltec military force under the leadership of Kukulcan. Following Charnay the term Toltec has since been associated with the influx of certain Central Mexican cultural traits into the Mayan sphere of dominance that took place in the late classic and early Post-classic periods; the Post-classic Mayan civilizations of Chichén Itzá, Mayapán, and the Guatemalan highlands have been referred to as ""Toltecized"" or ""Mexicanized"" Mayas.The historicist school of thought persisted well into the 20th century, represented in the works of scholars such as David Carrasco, Miguel León Portilla, Nigel Davies, and H. B. Nicholson, which all held the Toltecs to have been an actual ethnic group. This school of thought connected the ""Toltecs"" to the archaeological site of Tula, which was taken to be the Tollan of Aztec myth. This tradition assumes that much of central Mexico was dominated by a ""Toltec empire"" between the 10th and 12th century CE. The Aztecs referred to several Mexican city-states as Tollan, ""Place of Reeds"", such as ""Tollan Cholollan"". Archaeologist Laurette Sejourné, followed by the historian Enrique Florescano, have argued that the ""original"" Tollan was probably Teotihuacán.Anti-HistoricistOn the other side of the argument lie those who believe that the Aztec stories are clouded by myth and can therefore not be taken as an accurate account of the Toltec civilization. Some scholars argued that the Toltec era is best considered the fourth of the five Aztec mythical ""Suns"" or ages, the one immediately preceding the fifth sun of the Aztec people, presided over by Quetzalcoatl. This caused Graulich to consider that the only possibly historical data in the Aztec chronicles are the names of some rulers and possibly some of the conquests ascribed to them. While the skeptical school of thought does not deny that cultural traits of a seemingly central Mexican origin have diffused into a larger area of Mesoamerica, it tends to ascribe this to the dominance of Teotihuacán in the Classic period and the general diffusion of cultural traits within the region. Recent scholarship, then, does not see Tula, Hidalgo as the capital of the Toltecs of the Aztec accounts. Rather, it takes ""Toltec"" to mean simply an inhabitant of Tula during its apogee. Separating the term ""Toltec"" from those of the Aztec accounts, it attempts to find archaeological clues to the ethnicity, history and social organization of the inhabitants of Tula.Aztec Empire RisesTheAztecs were a Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people of central Mexico in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. They called themselves Mexica. The Republic of Mexico and its capital, Mexico City, derive their names from the word ""Mexica."" The capital of the Aztec empire was Tenochtitlan, built on a raised island in Lake Texcoco. Modern Mexico City is built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.[Figure 9]Model of the Aztec City of Tenochtitlan at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico CityFrom the 13th century, the Valley of Mexico was the heart of Aztec civilization: here the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance, the city of Tenochtitlan, was built upon raised islets in Lake Texcoco. The Triple Alliance formed a tributary empire expanding its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico, conquering other city-states throughout Mesoamerica. At its pinnacle, Aztec culture had rich and complex mythological and religious traditions, as well as reaching remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments. In 1521 Hernán Cortés, along with a large number of Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies, conquered Tenochtitlan and defeated the Aztec Triple Alliance under the leadership of Hueyi Tlatoani Moctezuma II. Subsequently, the Spanish founded the new settlement of Mexico City on the site of the ruined Aztec capital, from where they proceeded with the process of colonizing Central America.PoliticsThe Aztec Empire was an example of an empire that ruled by indirect means. Like most European empires, it was ethnically very diverse, but unlike most European empires, it was more of a system of tribute than a single system of government. Although the form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact, most areas within the empire were organized as city-states, known as altepetl in Nahuatl. These were small polities ruled by a king (tlatoani) from a legitimate dynasty.Two of the primary architects of the Aztec empire were the half-brothers Tlacaelel and Montezuma I, nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma, I succeeded Itzcoatl as Hueyi Tlatoani in 1440. Although he was also offered the opportunity to be tlatoani, Tlacaelel preferred to operate as the power behind the throne. Tlacaelel reformed the Aztec state and religion. According to some sources, he ordered the burning of most of the extant Aztec books claiming that they contained lies. He thereupon rewrote the history of the Aztec people, thus creating a common awareness of history for the Aztecs. This rewriting led directly to the curriculum taught to scholars and promoted the belief that the Aztecs were always a powerful and mythic nation; forgetting forever a possible true history of modest origins. One component of this reform was the institution of ritual war (the Flower Wars) as a way to have trained warriors and created the necessity of constant sacrifices to keep the Sun moving.EconomicsThe Aztec economy can be divided into a political sector, under the control of nobles and kings, and a commercial sector that operated independently of the political sector. The political sector of the economy centered on the control of land and labor by kings and nobles. Nobles owned all land, and commoners got access to farmland and other fields through a variety of arrangements, from rental through sharecropping to serf-like labor and slavery. These payments from commoners to nobles supported both the lavish lifestyles of the high nobility and the finances of city-states. Many luxury goods were produced for consumption by nobles. The producers of featherwork, sculptures, jewelry, and other luxury items were full-time commoner specialists who worked for noble patrons.ReligionThe Aztecs had at least two manifestations of the supernatural: tētl and tēixiptla. Tētl, which the Spaniards and European scholars routinely mistranslated as ""god"" or ""demon"", referred rather to an impersonal force that permeated the world. Tēixiptla, by contrast, denoted the physical representations (""idols"", statues and figurines) of the tētl as well as the human cultic activity surrounding this physical representation. The Mexica ""gods"" themselves had no existence as distinct entities apart from these tēixiptla representations of tētl. Veneration of Huitzilopochtli, the personification of the sun and of war, was central to the religious, social and political practices of the Mexicas. Huitzilopochtli attained this central position after the founding of Tenochtitlan and the formation of the Mexica city-state society in the 14th century. According to myth, Huitzilopochtli directed the wanderers to found a city on the site where they would see an eagle devouring a snake perched on a fruit-bearing nopal cactus. (It was said that Huitzilopochtli killed his nephew, Cópil, and threw his heart on the lake. Huitzilopochtli honored Cópil by causing a cactus to grow over Cópil's heart. ) Legend has it that this is the site on which the Mexicas built their capital city of Tenochtitlan. This legendary vision is pictured on the Coat of arms of Mexico. The Mexicas borrowed much of their culture from the ancient Toltec whom they seem to have at least partially confused with the more ancient civilization of Teotihuacan. To the Mexicas, the Toltecs were the originators of all culture.As all other Mesoamerican cultures, the Aztecs played a variant of the Mesoamerican ballgame, named tlachtli or ollamaliztli in Nahuatl. The game was played with a ball of solid rubber, called an olli, whence derives the Spanish word for rubber, hule. The players hit the ball with their hips, knees, and elbows and had to pass the ball through a stone ring to automatically win. The practice of the ballgame carried religious and mythological meanings and also served as a sport.Human sacrificeWhile human sacrifice was practiced throughout Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, if their own accounts are to be believed, brought this practice to an unprecedented level. For example, for the reconsecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days, reportedly by Ahuitzotl, the Great Speaker himself. This number, however, is not universally accepted. Accounts by the Tlaxcaltecas, the primary enemy of the Aztecs at the time of the Spanish Conquest, show that at least some of them considered it an honor to be sacrificed. In one legend, the warrior Tlahuicole was freed by the Aztecs but eventually returned of his own volition to die in ritual sacrifice. Tlaxcala also practiced the human sacrifice of captured Aztec Citizens.Andean CivilizationsMoche CultureThe Moche (also known as the Early Chimú or Mochica) lived in what is modern-day Peru near Moche and Trujillo. Their civilization lasted from approximately 100 to 800 CE. The Moche were less of a state or empire and more of a society- they lived in a general geographic area and shared cultural values, but were not governed under a uniform political system.Moche society was agriculturally based, with a significant level of investment in the construction of a network of irrigation canals for the diversion of river water to supply their crops. The Moche are particularly noted for their elaborately painted ceramics, gold work, monumental constructions (huacas) and irrigation systems.The Moche cultural sphere is centered around several valleys on the north coast of Peru and occupied 250 miles of desert coastline and up to 50 miles inland. The Huaca del Sol, a pyramidal adobe structure on the Rio Moche, was the largest pre-Columbian structure in Peru, but it was partly destroyed when Spanish Conquistadores mined its graves for gold in the 16th century. During the Spanish occupation of Peru in the early 17th century, colonists redirected the waters of the Moche River to run past the base of the Huaca del Sol in order to facilitate the looting of gold artifacts from the temple. The operation of the hydraulic mine greatly damaged the Huaca del Sol. In total, approximately two-thirds of the structure has been lost to erosion and such looting. The remaining structure stands at a height of 41 meters (135 feet). Looting and erosion due to El Niño continue to be major concerns to this day.The nearby Huaca de la Luna is better preserved. Its interior walls contain many colorful murals with complex iconography. The site has been under professional archaeological excavation since the early 1990s.ReligionBoth iconography and the finds of human skeletons in ritual contexts seem to indicate that human sacrifice played a significant part in Moche religious practices. These rites appear to have involved the elite as key actors in a spectacle of costumed participants, monumental settings and possibly the ritual consumption of blood. The Moche may have also held and tortured the victims for several weeks before sacrificing them, with the intent of deliberately drawing blood. The sacrifices may have been associated with rites of ancestral renewal and agricultural fertility, and some parts of the victim may have been eaten as a part of ritual cannibalism.Moche iconography features a figure which scholars have nicknamed the ""Decapitator"" or Ai Apaec; it is frequently depicted as a spider, but sometimes as a winged creature or a sea monster; together all three features symbolize land, water and air. When the body is included, the figure is usually shown with one arm holding a knife and another holding a severed head by the hair; it has also been depicted as ""a human figure with a tiger's mouth and snarling fangs.""ArtThe Moche are well known for their art, especially their naturalistic and articulate ceramics, particularly in the form of stirrup-spout vessels, that have come from the related ancient culture. The ceramics incorporate a wide-ranging subject matter, whether the actual form of the pot or the paintings on them, of representations that include people, animals and gods hunting and making war, music making, visiting rulers, burying the dead, curing the sick, anthropomorphic and ritual scenes. Moche ceramics illustrate all manner of behavior, both human and divine, through expressive modeling and painting, but there were certain reoccurring narrative themes throughout that defined their ideologies.Some of the ceramics have become known as ""sex-pots"": vessels depicting sexual acts. It is thought that these vessels were used for didactic purposes, and also as articulations of Moche culture. Because irrigation was the source of wealth and foundation of the empire, the Moche culture emphasized the importance of circulation and flow. Sexual themes in the pottery are posited to reflect Moche views of bodily fluids as an essential life force.The Moche also wove textiles, mostly using wool from vicuña and alpaca. Although there are few surviving examples of this, descendants of the Moche people have strong weaving traditions.CollapseThere are several theories as to what caused the demise of the Moche political structure. Some scholars have emphasized the role of environmental change. Studies of ice cores drilled from glaciers in the Andes reveal climatic events between 536 to 594 CE, possibly a super El Niño, that resulted in 30 years of intense rain and flooding followed by 30 years of drought, part of the aftermath of the climate changes of 535–536. These weather events could have disrupted the Moche way of life and shattered their faith in their religion, which had promised stable weather through sacrifices. Other evidence demonstrates that these events did not cause the final Moche demise. Moche polities survived beyond 650 CE in the Jequetepeque Valley and the Moche Valleys. For instance, in the Jequetepeque Valley, later settlements are characterized by fortifications and defensive works. While there is no evidence of a foreign invasion, as many scholars have suggested in the past, the defensive works suggest social unrest, possibly the result of climatic changes, as factions fought for control over increasingly scarce resources.The NazcaThe Nazca lived near the southern coast of Peru from 100 BCE to 800 CE. From 500* CE, the civilization started to decline and by 750 CE the civilization had fallen completely. Like the Moche, it is thought that the Nazca may have been forced into decline by environmental change. This is thought to have occurred when an El Niño triggered widespread and destructive flooding. Evidence also suggests that the Nazca people may have exacerbated the effects of these floods by gradually cutting down Prosopis pallida trees to make room for maize and cotton agriculture. These trees play an extremely important role as the ecological keystone of this landscape: in particular preventing river and wind erosion. Gradual removal of trees would have exposed the landscape to the effects of climate perturbations such as El Niño, leading to erosion and leaving irrigation systems high and drySociety and ReligionEarly Nazca society was made up of local chiefdoms and regional centers of power centered around Cahuachi, a non-urban ceremonial site of earthwork mounds and plazas.Likely related to the arid and extreme nature of the environment, Nazca religious beliefs were based upon agriculture and fertility. Much of Nazca art depicts powerful nature gods, such as the mythical killer whale, the harvesters, the mythical spotted cat, the serpentine creature, and the most prevalent of worshiped figures, the anthropomorphic mythical being. Much as in the contemporary Moche culture based in northwest Peru, shamans apparently used hallucinogenic drugs, such as extractions from the San Pedro cactus, to induce visions.Nazca subsistence was based largely on agriculture. Iconography on ceramics and excavated remains indicate that the Nazca people had a varied diet, composed of maize, squash, sweet potato, manioc and achira, and a small trace of various fish. They also used several non-food crops, such as cotton for textiles, coca, San Pedro cactus, and gourds. The latter was decorated to illustrate activities in daily life. The evidence of coca in society can be seen through remains but also through ceramics. This is the same for the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus, which has been illustrated in ceremonies on several polychrome pots and bowls. In terms of animal resources, the Nazca made sacrifices of llamas and guinea pigs at Cahuachi. Llamas were also commonly exploited as pack animals, for their wool, and as a source of meat.Nazca LinesThe geoglyphs of Nazca or ""Nazca Lines"" are a series of geometric shapes, miles of lines, and large drawings of animal figures (some as large as a football field) constructed on the desert floor in the Nazca region. Many theories have arisen about the great geoglyphs. A large number of people over an extended period of time could have constructed the lines. Researchers have demonstrated techniques to see how this was done. By extending a rope between two posts and removing the red pebbles on the desert surface along the rope, the lines could be constructed. The contrast of the red desert pebbles and the lighter earth beneath would make the lines visible from a high altitude. Due to the simplistic construction of the geoglyphs, regular amounts of rainfall would have easily eroded the drawings but the dry desert environment has preserved the lines for hundreds of years.The purpose of the lines continues to be debated, but it is unlikely that we will discover the true purpose of the geoglyphs.Trephination and cranial manipulationTrephination was a primitive skull surgery used by the Nazca that relieved pressure on the brain from battle wounds or for ritual purposes. It entails the removal of one or more sections of bone from the skull (while the person is still alive). Evidence of trephination has been seen through the analysis of excavated skulls. Some of the skulls show signs of healing, evidence that some individuals who underwent the procedure had survived.Elongated skulls, as a result of skull manipulation, were also seen in the excavations from Cahuachi. This effect was achieved by binding a cushion to an infant's forehead and board to the back of the head. Archaeologists can only speculate as to why this was done to some of the skulls. Several theories suggest skull manipulation created an ethnic identity, formed the individual into a social being, or may have illustrated social status.The Inca Empire[Figure 10]The Inca Empire, or Inka Empire, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. The civilization emerged in the 13th century and lasted until it was conquered by the Spanish in 1572. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco (also spelled Cuzco) in modern-day Peru. From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America. Beginning with the rule of Pachacuti-Cusi Yupanqui, the Inca expanded their borders to include large parts of modern Ecuador, Peru, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and north-central Chile, and southern Colombia.ReligionInca myths were an oral tradition until early Spanish colonists recorded them; however, some scholars believe that they may have been recorded onquipus, Andean knotted-string records. The Inca believed in reincarnation. Death was a passage to the next world that was full of difficulties. The spirit of the dead, camaquen, would need to follow a long dark road and during the trip, the assistance of a black dog that was able to see in the dark was required. Most Incas imagined the afterworld to be very similar to the Euro-American notion of heaven, with flower covered fields and snow-capped mountains. It was important for the Inca to ensure they did not die as a result of burning or that the body of the deceased did not become incinerated. This is because of the underlying belief that a vital force would disappear and threaten their passage to the afterworld. Those who obeyed the Inca moral code (do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy) went to live in the ""Sun's warmth"" while others spent their eternal days ""in the cold earth"".Though exaggerated by myth, it is true that the Incas made human sacrifices. As many as 4,000 servants, court officials, favorites, and concubines were killed upon the death of the Inca Huayna Capac in 1527, for example. The Incas also performed child sacrifices during or after important events, such as the death of the Sapa Inca or during a famine. These sacrifices were known ascapacocha.BuildersArchitecture was by far the most important of the Inca arts, with textiles reflecting motifs that were at their height in architecture. The main example is the capital city of Cusco. The site of Machu Picchu was constructed by Inca engineers. The stone temples constructed by the Inca used a mortarless construction that fit together so well that a knife could not be fitted through the stonework. Machu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca Empire. The construction of Machu Picchu appears to date from the period of the two great Incas, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–71) and Tupac Inca Yupanqui (1472–93). Machu Picchu was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest, possibly related to smallpox.This was a process first used on a large scale by the Pucara (ca. 300 BC–CE 300) peoples to the south in Lake Titicaca, and later in the great city of Tiwanaku (ca. CE 400–1100) in present-day Bolivia. The rocks used in construction were sculpted to fit together exactly by repeatedly lowering a rock onto another and carving away any sections on the lower rock where the dust was compressed. The tight fit and the concavity on the lower rocks made them extraordinarily stable.Video AssignmentThe Aztec, Maya, Inca, And Olmec History Documentaryby Ian C.

[WHS.7D]Describethe historical origins, central ideas, and spread of major religious and philosophical traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, and the development of monotheism. [WHS.23A]European TransitionDuring the 14thcentury, events were taking place in Europe that would forever change its landscape, encourage a questioning of Church authority, and help bring about the end of the 1,000 year medieval period. Four events in particular helped bring about the end of the medieval period in Europe.The Great Famine(1313 - 1322)A period of unusually strong rains in Europe led to flooding. Eventually, crops spoiled and livestock drowned, resulting in theGreat Famine. Farm animals that were needed for work were slaughtered for food, and seed grain was eaten. This shortage of grain increased prices by the more six times. Millions of people died from the famine and began the question the Church why this catastrophe was happening.Black DeathTheBlack Death, orbubonic plague, struck only 25 years after the Great Famine. Rats with fleas carrying the disease entered Europe form Asia on trading ships. Between 1347 and 1351, 25 million people, about one-third of Europe’s population, died in this epidemic. People were buried in mass graves without receiving any blessing from the Church. Some blamed the Jews for poisoning wells; others claimed the plague was God’s punishment for sinful living. Once again, the Church appeared helpless before this second great catastrophe of the 14thcentury.“Daily life, such as it had become, was balanced by daily death. Acquaintances disappeared and dreadful signs appeared on front doors, warning visitors away. The shouts of street vendors hawking their wares were replaced by the coarse calls of ""Bring out the dead!"" Two-wheeled tumbrels piled high with corpses and the dying creaked along the streets in the place of carts brimming with fresh groceries and other merchandise. Fires burned not to cook food or warm bodies, but to incinerate victims' belongings, punish criminals, or fumigate the supposedly ""poisonous"" atmosphere. In the face of pestilence people's faith in doctors and Catholic priests waned, and for many it shifted to self-help medical books and Protestantism.”Trade Was to BlameGrowing stability in Europe in the late middle ages made possible extensive trade between East and West and within Europe itself. Italian city-states such as Venice and Genoa had trading ports in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black sea—trade that made these cities among the wealthiest cities in Europe. Most historians today generally agree that the plague was likely spread through Eurasia via these trade routes by parasites carried on the backs of rodents.The bacterium Yersinia pestis (and not all historians agree this was the culprit) likely traveled from China to the northwestern shores of the Caspian Sea, then part of the Mongol Empire and by the spring of 1346, Italian merchants in the Crimea, specifically the Genoese-dominated city of Kaffa (today Feodosiya in the Ukraine) brought the disease west. Rats carrying infected fleas boarded ships bound for Constantinople (today Istanbul in Turkey), capital of the Byzantine Empire. Inhabitants there were sickened by the plague by early July.From these Greek-speaking lands, the plague spread to North Africa and the Middle East with terrible consequences; by autumn 1347, it had reached the French port of Marseilles and progressed both north and west. By early November, the Italian city-states of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice—commercial hubs for European trade—had been struck.Most of the rest of Europe followed in short order. The disease spread along the active trade routes that northern Italian and Flemish merchants had developed. London and Bruges then communicated the disease via busy shipping lanes to the Nordic countries and the Baltic region (aided by a trading partnership known as the Hanseatic League). Western crusaders seeking to attack the Holy Land prompted innovations in shipbuilding and these larger and faster ships carried large quantities of goods over extensive trade networks— but they also carried the deadly pathogen.Economic ImpactThe Black Death turned the economy upside-down. It disrupted trade and put manufacturing on hold as skilled artisans and merchants died by the thousands—not to mention the customers who bought their wares. Workers’ wages skyrocketed as arable land lay fallow; landlords, desperate for people to work their land, were forced to renegotiate farmers’ wages. Famine followed. Widespread death eroded the strict hereditary class divisions that had, for centuries, bound peasants to land owned by local lords.People struggled to understand what was happening. In Western Europe a terrified populace often turned to their Christian faith. As a result, the Church became wealthier as many of those stricken, in an effort to assure a place in heaven, willed their property to the Church. But the authority of the Church also suffered. as some pointed to the “astrological skies that revealed Saturn in the house of Jupiter” as the cause of the tragedy.Did the Black Death contribute to the Renaissance?The Black Death radically disrupted society, but did the social, political and religious upheaval created by the plague contribute to the Renaissance? Some historians say yes. With so much land readily available to survivors, the rigid hierarchical structure that marked pre-plague society became more fluid. The Medici family, important patrons of Italian Renaissance culture, originated in the rural area of Mugello in Tuscany and moved to Florence soon after the plague. They initially established their fortune in the wool trade and then branched out into banking. As the family achieved wealth and power, they promoted such artists as Filippo Lippi, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo—not to mention producing four popes and two regent queens of France. Would such mobility have been possible without the social and economic upheaval caused by the Black Death? Historians will likely debate this question for many years.by Louisa WoodvilleAll Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Byrne, Joseph. ""Black Death: Overview."" Daily Life through History. ABC-CLIO, 2015. Web. 22 July 2015.[Figure 2]This image depicts victims of the plague being buried. The people that are being buried are the people of Tournai in 1349. This image also depicts that they make coffins out of pieces of lumber. The lumber is being brought in by men on the left of the picture to make the coffins. Then there are people that are digging holes for the coffins to go into. Then two people are placing the coffins placed into the holes that were dug. It also depicts that socially many people died because of the Black Death. It also shows the economic affect because so many people had to work just to bury the people.Ultimately, the plague caused a serious shortage of labor in Europe resulting in many peasants escaping serfdom, as landowners and towns, needing laborers, offered them freedom in exchange for work. The manorial system that relied on an abundance of free labor, was nearing an end.The Hundred Years War(1337 – 1453)This war between England and France, lasting on and off for 116 years, began when an English king claimed the throne of France after the death of the French king. The conflict is especially noteworthy for stirring nationalist feelings amongst the combating nations and reducing the importance of knights in battle, as each king developed a standing army of foot soldiers. New weapons, especially the long-bow and canon, helped render both knights and castles less effective. The era of medieval warfare was nearing an end.Joan of Arc, a young French maiden, rallied French troops around the heir to the French throne. She turned the tide in favor of the French when she successfully drove the English out of the city of Orleans and crowned the new French king at Rheims Cathedral. Later, Joan was capture and burned a the stake by the English as a witch. But within 20 years after her death, the war was over. From this point forward, England and France emerged as distinct nations.The Great Schism(1378 – 1417)In 1305, a Frenchman was elected Pope and moved the Papacy from Rome to Avignon, France. Then, in 1378, an Italian was elected as Pope who decided to move the Papacy back to Rome. French cardinals claimed this election was unlawful and elected a French Pope to keep the Papacy in France. The true Pope of the Catholic Church was left uncertain. Thisschism,or split, greatly weakened Church authority. A Church Council made matter worse by electing a third Pope in 1409. Finally, a new Church Council deposed all three Popes, and elected a single Pope in 1417, but by then Church prestige had been greatly weakened.Baroque Art in EuropeWhen Martin Luther tacked his 95 theses to the doors of Wittenberg Cathedral in 1517 protesting the Catholic Church's corruption, he initiated a movement that would transform the religious, political and artistic landscape of Europe. For the next century, Europe would be in turmoil as new political and religious boundaries were determined, often through bloody military conflicts. Only in 1648, with the signing  of the Treaty of Westphalia, did the conflicts between Protestants and Catholics subside in continental Europe.Martin Luther focused his critique on what he saw as the Church's greed and abuse of power. He called Rome, the seat of papal power, ""the whore of Babylon"" decked out in finery of expensive art, grand architecture, and sumptuous banquets. The church responded to the crisis in two ways: by internally addressing issues of corruption and by defending the doctrines rejected by the Protestants. Thus, while the first two decades of the 16th century were a period of lavish spending for the Papacy, the middle decades were a period of austerity. As one visitor to Rome noted in 1560's, the entire city had become a convent. Piety and asceticism ruled the day.View of the Cerasi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome with Annibale Carracci's altarpiece, The Assumption of the Virgin, 1600-01, oil on canvas, 96 × 61 inches, and paintings by Caravaggio on the side walls (The Crucifixion of St. Peter on the left, and The Conversion of Paul on the right)By the end of the 16th century, the Catholic Church was once again feeling optimistic, even triumphant. It had emerged from the crisis with renewed vigor and clarity of purpose. Shepherding the faithful—instructing them on Catholic doctrines and inspiring virtuous behavior—took center stage. Keen to rebuild Rome’s reputation as a holy city, the Papacy embarked on extensive building and decoration campaigns aimed at highlighting its ancient origins, its beliefs, and its divinely-sanctioned authority. In the eyes of faithful Catholics, Rome was not an unfaithful whore, but a pure bride, beautifully adorned for her union with her divine spouse.The Art of Persuasion: Instruct, Delight, MoveWhile the Protestants harshly criticized the cult of images, the Catholic Church ardently embraced the religious power of art. The visual arts, the Church argued, played a key role in guiding the faithful. They were certainly as important as the written and spoken word, and perhaps even more important since they were accessible to the learned and the unlearned alike. In order to be effective in its pastoral role, religious art had to be clear, persuasive, and powerful. Not only did it have to instruct, it had to inspire. It had to move the faithful to feel the reality of Christ’s sacrifice, the suffering of the martyrs, the visions of the saints.Caravaggio, The Crowning with Thorns, 1602-04, oil on canvas, 165.5 x 127 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna)Other artists, like Annibale Carracci—who also experimented with realism—ultimately settled on a more classical visual language, inspired by the vibrant palette, idealized forms, and balanced compositions of the High Renaissance, see image above. Still others, like Giovanni Battista Gaulli, turned to daring feats of illusionism that blurred not only the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and architecture, but also those between the real and depicted worlds. In so doing, the divine was made physically present and palpable. Whether through shocking realism, dynamic movement, or exuberant ornamentation, 17th-century art was meant to impress. It aimed to convince the viewer of the truth of its message by impacting the senses, awakening the emotions, and activating—even sharing—the viewer’s space.Giovanni Battista Gauli, also known as il Baciccio, The Triumph of the Name of Jesus II, Gesù, ceiling fresco, 1672-1685.The Catholic Monarchs and their TerritoriesThe monarchs of Spain, Portugal, and France also embraced the more ornate elements of 17th-century art to celebrate Catholicism. In Spain and its colonies, rulers invested vast resources on elaborate church facades, stunning, gold-covered chapels and tabernacles, and strikingly-realistic polychrome sculpture. In the Spanish Netherlands, where sacred art had suffered terribly as a result of the Protestant iconoclasm—the destruction of art—civic and religious leaders prioritized the adornment of churches as the region reclaimed its Catholic identity. Refurnishing the altars of Antwerp’s churches kept Peter Paul Rubens’ workshop busy for many years. Europe’s monarchs also adopted this artistic vocabulary to proclaim their own power and status. Louis XIV, for example, commissioned the splendid buildings and gardens of Versailles as a visual expression of his divine right to rule.The Protestant NorthMap of Northern Europe, c. 1700In the Protestant countries, and especially in the newly-independent Dutch Republic, modern-day Holland, the artistic climate changed radically in the aftermath of the Reformation. Two of the wealthiest sources of patronage—the monarchy and the Church—were now gone. In their stead arose an increasingly prosperous middle class eager to express its status and its new sense of national pride through the purchase of art.By the middle of the 17th century, a new market had emerged to meet the artistic tastes of this class. The demand was now for smaller-scale paintings suitable for display in private homes. These paintings included religious subjects for private contemplation, as seen in Rembrandt’s poignant paintings and prints of biblical narratives, as well as portraits documenting individual likenesses.Judith Leyster, Self-Portrait, c. 1630, oil on canvas, 651 x 746 cm (National Gallery of Art, Washington)In the context of European history, the period from c. 1585 to c. 1700/1730 is often called the Baroque era. The word baroque derives from the Portuguese and Spanish words for a large, irregularly-shaped pearl—barroco and barrueco, respectively. Eighteenth-century critics were the first to apply the term to the art of the 17th century. It was not a term of praise. To the eyes of these critics, who favored the restraint and order of Neoclassicism, the works of Bernini, Borromini, and Pietro da Cortona appeared bizarre, absurd, even diseased—in other words, misshapen, like an imperfect pearl.By the middle of the 19th century, the word baroque had lost its pejorative implications and was used to describe the ornate and complex qualities present in many examples of 17th-century art, music, and literature. Eventually, the term came to designate the historical period as a whole.In the context of painting, for example, the stark realism of Zurbaran’s altarpieces, the quiet intimacy of Vermeer’s domestic interiors, and the restrained classicism of Poussin’s landscapes are all Baroque—now with a capital B to indicate the historical period—regardless of the absence of the stylistic traits originally associated with the term.Scholars continue to debate the validity of this label, admitting the usefulness of having a label for this distinct historical period, while also acknowledging its limitations in characterizing the variety of artistic styles present in the 17th century.by Dr. Esperança CamaraAll Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Video AssignmentDisease!by The Crash CourseLuther and the Protestant Reformationby Crash CourseHow important was the church during the 16th century?

[WHS.1D]Explainnew economic factors and principles that contributed to the success of Europe's Commercial Revolution.[WHS.7F]Formulategeneralizations on how economic freedom improved the human condition, based on students' knowledge of the benefits of free enterprise in Europe's Commercial Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and 20th-century free market economies, compared to communist command economies.Analyzeinformation by sequencing, categorizing, identifying cause-and-effect relationships, comparing, contrasting, finding the main idea, summarizing, making generalizations and predictions, drawing inferences and conclusions, and developing connections between historical events over timeThe Commercial RevolutionTheCommercial Revolutionwas a period ofEuropeaneconomic expansion,colonialism, andmercantilismwhich lasted from approximately the late 13th century until the early 18th century. It was succeeded in the mid-18th century by theIndustrial Revolution. Beginning with theCrusades, Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, and trade expanded in the second half of theMiddle Ages. Europeanstates, throughvoyages of discovery, were looking for new trade routes in the 15th and 16th centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, newinternational tradenetworks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, Europeans had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of financial services such as banking, insurance, and investing.The commercial revolution ran from approximately the late 13th century, through the 18th century,withWalt Whitman Rostowsaying the beginning is ""arbitrarily"" 1488, the year the first European sailed around theCape of Good Hope.Historians Peter Spufford, Robert S. Lopez and Irving W. Raymond indicate that there was a commercial revolution of the 13th century, or that it began at this point, rather than later.BanksOne of the economic developments to come out of the Commercial revolution was the development of banking. Various legal and religious developments in the late Middle Ages allowed for development of the modern banking system at the beginning of the 16th century. Interest was allowed to be charged, and profits generated from holding other people's money.Banks in the Italian Peninsula had great difficulty operating at the end of the 14th century, for lack of silver and gold coin.Nevertheless, by the later 16th century, enough bullion was available, thanks to discoveries in the New World that many more people could keep a small amount hoarded and used as capital.In response to this extra available money, northern European banking interests came along; among them was theFuggerfamily. The Fuggers were originally mine owners, but soon became involved in banking, charging interest, and other financial activities. They dealt with everyone, from small time individuals, to the highest nobility. Their banks even loaned to the emperors and kings, eventually goingbankruptwhen their clients defaulted.This family, and other individuals, used Italian methods which outpaced theHanseatic League's ability to keep up with the changes occurring in northern Europe.Banking in Italian PeninsulaThe Dukes of BurgundyIn the 15th century, the northern European countries we know today as Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were controlled by the enormously wealthy Dukes of Burgundy (Burgundy is a region in France). This region during the 15th century is often referred to, today, as the Burgundian Netherlands. The court of the Dukes of Burgundy were the most important patrons of the early Northern Renaissance, but newly wealthy private citizens also commissioned art as part of a growing interest in private meditation and prayer. Portraits were also commissioned in growing numbers.Like Florence, cities in Northern Europe (Bruges, Ghent and then later Antwerp and Brussels), were rich industrial and banking centers during this period and this allowed a large merchant-class to flourish creating an ideal environment for artistic production.Classical Antiquity?In Italy, the renaissance was deeply influenced by the art and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome—in part because the art and architecture of antiquity was more immediately available (ruins were plentiful in many cities). Northern Europe however did not have such ready access to ancient monuments and so tended to draw instead more directly from medieval traditions such as manuscript illuminations.Oil Paint: glazesThough the medium of oil paint had been in use since the late middle ages, the artists of the North more fully exploited this medium’s unique characteristics. Using thin layers of paint, called glazes, northern artists created a depth of  color that was entirely new, and because oil paint can imitate textures far better than fresco or tempera, it was perfectly suited to representing the material reality that was so important to Renaissance artists and their patrons. In the Northern Renaissance, we see artists making the most of oil paint—creating the illusion of light reflecting on metal surfaces or jewels, and textures that appear like real fur, hair, wool or wood.The great artists of this period created work that reflected their increasingly mercantile world, even when they worked for the court of the Dukes. The spiritual world reigned supreme but the representation of wealth and power were also a hugely important motive for patrons whether a pope, a duke, or a banker.Essay by Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven ZuckerAll Khan Academy content is available for free atwww.khanacademy.org.Joint Stock Companies and Stock ExchangesStock exchanges were developed as the volume of stock transactions increased. The London Royal Exchange established in 1565 first developed as a securities market, though by 1801 it had become a stock exchange.‪Historian Fernand Braudel suggests that in Cairo in the 11th-century Muslim and Jewish merchants had already set up every form of trade association and had knowledge of every method of credit and payment, disproving the belief that these were invented later by Italians. In 12th century France thecourratiers de changewere concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first brokers. In late 13th century Bruges commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man calledVan der Beurse, and in 1309 they became the ""Bruges Beurse"", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting. The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring counties and ""Beurzen"" soon opened in Ghent and Amsterdam.‪""In the middle of the 13th century Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds.""‪Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This practice was only possible, because these independent city states were not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. The Dutch later started joint stock companies, which let shareholders invest in business ventures and get a share of their profits - or losses. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company issued the first shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It was the first company to issue stocks and bonds.‪The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (or Amsterdam Beurs) is also said to have been the first stock exchange to introduce continuous trade in the early 17th century. The Dutch ""pioneered short selling, option trading, debt-equity swaps, merchant banking, unit trusts and other speculative instruments, much as we know them.""MercantilismOne of the ideas to come out of the Commercial Revolution wasmercantilism,an economic theory and practice, dominant in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries that promoted governmental regulation of a nation's economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers. It was the economic counterpart of political absolutism or absolute monarchies. Mercantilism includes a nationaleconomic policy aimed at accumulatingmonetary reserves through a positivebalance of trade, especially offinished goods. Historically, such policies frequently led to war and also motivated colonial expansion. Mercantilist theory varies in sophistication from one writer to another and has evolved over time. High tariffs, especially on manufactured goods, are an almost universal feature of mercantilist policy.Mercantilism led to wars between European powers for control of maritime trade routes—such as the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries. It also created thetriangular tradein the North Atlantic, which involved the export of raw materials from the colonies to Britain, the transportation of enslaved Africans to the Americas, and the subsequent importation of manufactured goods from Britain to the colonies.British economic policy was mercantilist in nature. The British Parliament enacted such mechanisms as protectionist trade barriers, governmental regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries for the purpose of augmenting British finances at the expense of colonial territories and other European imperial powers. England also sought to prevent its colonies in North America from trading with other European countries and from developing a robust manufacturing industry. To this end, beginning in 1651, the British Parliament adopted a series of legislation known as theNavigation Acts.Video AssignmentCapitalism and the Dutch East India Companyby The Crash CourseWhere was trade flourishing before it took hold of the South China Sea?Who was the British East India Company's biggest competitor?What was Coen's plan?Interactive Notebook AssignmentsUse the internet or your school library to investigate the effects of the Commercial Revolution on one European nation.

[WHS.7B]Explainthe impact of the Atlantic slave trade on West Africa and the Americas.[WHS.7C]Explainthe impact of the Ottoman Empire on Eastern Europe and global trade. [WHS.7D]A Prelude to the Age of DiscoveryEuropean medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of Byzantine Empire was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends, dating back from the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great and his successors.In 1154, Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi created a description of the world and world map, the Tabula Rogeriana, at the court of King Roger II of Sicily, but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African kingdoms beyond the Sahara, but the factual knowledge was limited to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from old Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of Roman exploration of Mauritania. The Red Sea was barely known and only trade links with the Maritime republics, the Republic of Venice especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing Eurasia by land in the late Middle Ages. Although the Mongols had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction, Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the Pax Mongolica allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China. A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the Maritime republics.From the 8th century until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice and neighboring maritime republics held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving spices, incense, herbs, drugs and opium, made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in medieval medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics, perfumery, as well as food additives and preservatives[Figure 2]Marco PoloMarco Polo was an Italian merchant traveler from Venice whose travels are recorded in Livres des merveilles du monde, a book which did much to introduce Europeans to Central Asia and China. Marco Polo was not the first European to reach China, but he was the first to leave a detailed chronicle of his experience. This book inspiredChristopher Columbusand many other travelers.The main trade routes from the east passed through the Byzantine Empire or the Arab lands and onwards to the ports of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. Luxury goods bought in the Levant, such as spices, dyes, and silks were imported to Italy and then resold throughout Europe. Moreover, the inland city-states profited from the rich agricultural land of the Po valley.From France, Germany, and the Low Countries, through the medium of the Champagne fairs, land and river trade routes brought goods such as wool, wheat, and precious metals into the region. The extensive trade that stretched from Egypt to the Baltic generated substantial surpluses that allowed significant investment in mining and agriculture.Thus, while northern Italy was not richer in resources than many other parts of Europe, the level of development, stimulated by trade, allowed it to prosper. In particular, Florence became one of the wealthiest of the cities of Northern Italy, due mainly to its woolen textile production, developed under the supervision of its dominant trade guild, the Arte della Lana. Wool was imported from Northern Europe (and in the 16th century from Spain) and together with dyes from the east were used to make high quality textiles.The Transfer of Culture and KnowledgeThe Italian trade routes that covered the Mediterranean and beyond were also major conduits of culture and knowledge. The recovery of lost Greek classics (and, to a lesser extent, Arab advancements on them) following the Crusader conquest of the Byzantine heartlands, revitalized medieval philosophy in the Renaissance of the 12th century, just as the refugee Byzantine scholars who migrated to Italy during and following the Ottomans conquest of the Byzantines between the 12th and 15th centuries were important in sparking the new linguistic studies of the Renaissance, in newly created academies in Florence and Venice. Humanist scholars searched monastic libraries for ancient manuscripts and recovered Tacitus and other Latin authors. The rediscovery of Vitruvius meant that the architectural principles of Antiquity could be observed once more, and Renaissance artists were encouraged, in the atmosphere of humanist optimism, to excel the achievements of the Ancients, like Apelles, of whom they read.Established Trade RoutesIn the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the Hanseatic League of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The city-states of Italy expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the Holy Roman Empire; apart from the Kingdom of Naples, outside powers kept their armies out of Italy. During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with double-entry book-keeping, joint stock companies, an international banking system, a systematized foreign exchange market, insurance, and government debt. Florence became the center of this financial industry and the gold florin became the main currency of international trade.While Roman, urban, republican sensibilities persisted, there were many movements and changes afoot. Italy first felt the changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was: A rise in population―the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion). An emergence of huge cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as Genoa, Bologna and Verona, which had over 50,000 inhabitants) The rebuilding of the great cathedrals. Substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)An Agrarian RevolutionA feature of the High Middle Ages in Northern Italy was the rise of the urban communes which had broken from the control by bishops and local counts. In much of the region, the landed nobility was poorer than the urban patriarchs in the High Medieval money economy whose inflationary rise left land-holding aristocrats impoverished. The increase in trade during the early Renaissance enhanced these characteristics.The decline of feudalism and the rise of cities influenced each other; for example, the demand for luxury goods led to an increase in trade, which led to greater numbers of tradesmen becoming wealthy, who, in turn, demanded more luxury goods. This change also gave the merchants almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states, again enhancing trade. One of the most important effects of this political control was security. Those that grew extremely wealthy in a feudal state ran constant risk of running afoul of the monarchy and having their lands confiscated, as famously occurred to Jacques Coeur in France. The northern states also kept many medieval laws that severely hampered commerce, such as those against usury, and prohibitions on trading with non-Christians. In the city-states of Italy, these laws were repealed or rewritten.The Age of DiscoveryThe Age of Discovery is a historical period of European global exploration that started in the early 15th century with the first Portuguese discoveries in the Atlantic Archipelagos and Africa, as well as the discovery of America by Spain in 1492, and the discovery of the ocean route to the East in 1498, and by a series of European naval expeditions across the Atlantic and later the Pacific, which continued until the 18th century.The Age of Discovery sometimes regarded as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era, along with its contemporary Renaissance movement. European overseas expansion led to the rise of colonial empires, with the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the Columbian Exchange: a wide transfer of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases and culture between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. This represented one of the most-significant global events concerning ecology, agriculture, and culture in history. European exploration allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations acknowledging each other, reaching the most-remote boundaries much later.During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese sailors were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of Africa, Asia and Brazil. Methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of prince Henry the Navigator, with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later,Vasco da Gamaled the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Soon, after reaching Brazil, explorations proceed to southeast Asia, having reached Japan in 1542.[Figure 3]Atlantic Exploration (1415–1488)In 1415, the city of Ceuta was occupied by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast, moved by expanding Christianity with the avail of the Pope and a desire of the unemployed nobility for epic acts of war after the reconquista. Young prince Henry the Navigator was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the Saharan trade routes.Henry the Navigator took the lead role in encouraging Portuguese maritime exploration until his death in 1460. At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond Cape Bojador on the African coast. Henry wished to know how far the Muslim territories in Africa extended, and whether it was possible to reach Asia by sea to reach the source of the lucrative spice trade.A Portuguese attempt to capture Grand Canary, one of the nearby Canary Islands, which had been partially settled by Spaniards in 1402 was unsuccessful and met with protestations from Castile. At around the same time as the unsuccessful attack on the Canary Islands, the Portuguese began to explore the North African coast.Indian Ocean explorations lead by Vasco da Gama (1497–1542)The long-standing Portuguese goal of finding a sea route to Asia was finally achieved in a ground-breaking voyage commanded by Vasco da Gama. Gama's voyage was significant and paved the way for the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire in Asia. The route meant that the Portuguese would not need to cross the highly disputed Mediterranean nor the dangerous Arabian Peninsula, and that the whole voyage would be made by sea.After decades of sailors trying to reach India with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks, Gama landed in Calicut on 20 May 1498. Reaching the legendary Indian spice routes unopposed helped the Portuguese Empire improve its economy that, until Gama, was mainly based on trades along Northern and coastal West Africa. These spices were mostly pepper and cinnamon at first, but soon included other products, all new to Europe which led to a commercial monopoly for several decades.How Portugal Became the First Global Sea PowerPick your adjective for the monster wave McNamara rode in January just off the Portuguese coast near Nazare. The Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, came to Nazare, too, to pray before he set out in 1497 -- and again after a successful return from his voyage to find a sea route to India with its rich spice trade. He did what Christopher Columbus tried to do but failed. Casimiro said that as a country, Portugal turns to the sea: ""Our backs are turned to the land, and we are always looking at the sea. We have that kind of impulse to see what is after that. "" Even if it's frightening? ""Yeah. "" Portugal is a country where the sea is and always has been regarded as a living being -- to be stared down, confronted.How Portugal became the first global sea powerPick your adjective for the monster wave McNamara rode in January just off the Portuguese coast near Nazare.

Christopher Columbus was a navigator and an admiral for Spain who made four voyages to the Americas, the first being in 1492 which resulted in the ""discovery of America"" from a European point of view. Portugal had been the main European power interested in pursuing trade routes overseas, however soon Spain and other European kingdoms sent expeditions and established colonies throughout the New World. They converted the native inhabitants to Christianity and built large trade networks across the Atlantic which introduced new plants, animals, and food crops in both continents.Columbus's First VoyageColumbus was given the title ""Admiral of the Ocean Sea"" in April 1492. He wanted to lead his own expedition and was a trained sailor and ready to lead. However, he needed someone to fund his voyage, so he went to the king of Portugal, John II, who immediately declined. Columbus turned then to Queen Isabella of Spain who reluctantly funded him. On September 6, he departed San Sebastián de la Gomera for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.In his first journey, Columbus visited San Salvador in The Bahamas (which he was convinced was Japan), Cuba (which he thought was China) and Hispaniola (where he found gold). Land was first sighted at 2 a.m. on October 12, 1492, by a sailor named Rodrigo de Triana (also known as Juan Rodriguez Bermejo) aboard La Pinta. Columbus would later assert that he had first seen the land and, thus, earned the reward of 10,000 maravedís.[Figure 4]""The First Voyage"", chromolithograph by L. Prang & Co., published by The Prang Educational Co., Boston, 1893. Imaginary scene of Christopher Columbus bidding farewell to the Queen of Spain on his departure for the New World, August 3, 1492.Columbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. Columbus founded the settlement, La Navidad, leaving behind 39 men and on January 15, 1493, he set sail for home by way of the Azores. Columbus was received as a hero in Spain. He displayed several indigenous persons and what gold he had found to the court, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock.Second voyageBefore he left Spain on his second voyage, Columbus had been directed by Ferdinand and Isabella to maintain friendly, even loving, relations with the indigenous people, the natives. He set sail on September 24, 1493.During the second voyage, Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas people. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and enslaved five hundred and sixty people. The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the Cortes, some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their Americas homeland.Third VoyageAccording to the abstract of Columbus' journal made by Bartolomé de Las Casas, the object of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal claimed was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. On May 30, 1498, Columbus left port with a fleet of six ships. From August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the Gulf of Paria which separates Trinidad from mainland Venezuela. He then explored the mainland of South America and described these new lands as belonging to a previously unknown new continent, but he pictured it hanging from China.Governorship IssuesColumbus returned from South America to Hispaniola on August 19, 1498 to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were discontent, having been misled by Columbus about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world.During Columbus' term as Viceroy and Governor of the Indies, he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called 'the tyrant of the Caribbean. ' Columbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement.Columbus and his brothers lingered in jail for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered their release. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the Alhambra palace in Granada. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus' fourth voyage.Fourth ExplorationColumbus made a fourth voyage, nominally in search of a westward passage to the Indian Ocean leaving Spain on May 12, 1502. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, before arriving in Almirante Bay, Panama on October 16, 1502.He left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, on June 25, 1503.For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. Help finally arrived, from the governor, on June 29, 1504, and Columbus and his men arrived in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Castile, on November 7, 1504.Columbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54.LegacyThe success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and through the Indian Reductions practice to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.Columbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.Spanish Conquest of the AztecsThe Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire was one of the most significant events not only in the Spanish colonization of the Americas but also in world history. The conquest must be understood within the context of Spanish patterns on the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista by Christians, defeating the Muslims, and also patterns extended in the Caribbean following Christopher Columbus establishment of permanent European settlement in the Caribbean. The Spanish authorized expeditions or entradas for the discovery, conquest, and colonization of new territory, using existing Spanish settlements as a base. Many of those on the Cortés expedition of 1519 had never seen combat before. In fact, Cortés had never commanded men in battle before. However, there was a whole generation of Spaniards who participated in expeditions in the Caribbean, learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises.[Figure 5]Hernándo CortésDespite some early battles between the two, Cortés allied himself with the Aztecs' long-time enemy, the Confederacy of Tlaxcala, and arrived at the gates of Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. During the Spanish conquest of Mexico, the Tlaxcala alliance with the Spaniards against the Aztecs supplied a large contingent for the Spanish-led army that eventually destroyed the Aztec empire.The Spaniards and their Tlaxcallan allies became increasingly dangerous and unwelcome guests in the capital city. In June 1520, hostilities broke out, culminating in the massacre in the Main Temple and the death of Moctezuma II. The Spaniards fled the town on July 1, an episode later characterized as La Noche Triste (the Sad Night). They and their native allies returned in the spring of 1521 to lay siege to Tenochtitlan, a battle that ended on August 13 with the destruction of the city. Simultaneously, the Aztecs suffered from a smallpox outbreak that killed between 10 and 50% of the population. This further weakened the Aztecs.During this period the now crumbling empire went through a rapid line of ruler succession. After the death of Moctezuma II, the empire fell into the hands of severely weakened emperors, such as Cuitláhuac, before eventually being ruled by puppet rulers, such as Andrés de Tapia Motelchiuh, installed by the Spanish. The Aztec Empire ceased to exist with the Spanish final conquest of Tenochtitlan in August 1521. The empire had been composed of separate city-states that had either allied with or been conquered by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan and rendered tribute to the Mexica while maintaining their internal ruling structures. Those polities now came under Spanish rule, also retaining their internal structures of ruling elites, tribute-paying commoners, and land holding and other economic structures largely intact.When news reached Cortés of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz, he took the opportunity to take Moctezuma captive in his own palace and ruled through him for months. Capturing the cacique or indigenous ruler was the standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Moctezuma had considerable precedent. When Cortés left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, Pedro de Alvarado was left in charge. Alvarado allowed a significant Aztec feast to be celebrated in Tenochtitlan and on the pattern of the earlier massacre in Cholula, closed off the square and massacred the celebrating Aztec noblemen. The biography of Cortés by Francisco López de Gómara contains a description of the massacre. The Alvarado massacre at the Main Temple of Tenochtitlan precipitated rebellion by the population of the city. When the captured emperor Moctezuma II, now seen as a mere puppet of the invading Spaniards, attempted to calm outraged Aztecs, he was killed by a projectile. Cortés, who by then had returned to Tenochtitlan, and his men had to fight their way out of the capital city during the Noche Triste in June 1520. However, the Spanish and Tlaxcalans would return with reinforcements and a siege that led to the fall of Tenochtitlan a year later on August 13, 1521.The Aztec Empire ceased to exist with the Spanish final conquest of Tenochtitlan in August 1521. The empire had been composed of separate city-states that had either allied with or been conquered by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan and rendered tribute to the Mexica while maintaining their internal ruling structures. Those polities now came under Spanish rule, also retaining their internal structures of ruling elites, tribute-paying commoners, and land holding and other economic structures largely intact. The fall of the Aztec Empire was the key event in the formation of New Spain, which would later be known as Mexico.To reward to Spaniards who participated in the conquest what is now contemporary Mexico, the Spanish crown authorized grants of native labor in particular indigenous communities via theEncomienda. The indigenous were not slaves, chattel bought and sold or removed from their home community, but the system was one of forced labor. The indigenous of Central Mexico had practices rendering labor and tribute products to their polity's elites and those elites to the Mexica overlords in Tenochtitlan, so the Spanish system of encomienda was built on pre-existing patterns.The Spanish conquerors in Mexico during the early colonial era lived off the labor of the indigenous. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the indigenous peoples, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas suggested importing black slaves to replace them (he later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves).Nevertheless, Aztec culture survives today. Modern day Mexico City is built on the site of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. There are still 1.5 million people who speak the Aztec language of Nahuatl, and part of the Mexica migration story appears on the Mexican flag.Spanish Conquest of the IncasSpanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro and his brothers explored south from what is today Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526. They were in search of gold, and found riches in the Inca Empire, leading to their strong desire to conquer it. With superior technology and military tactics (and smallpox, a European disease the Incas had not built up an immunity to), the Spanish defeated the Inca in 1572.After the fall of the Inca Empire, many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system, known as the vertical archipelago model of agriculture. Spanish colonial officials used the Inca mita corvée labor system for colonial aims, sometimes brutally. One member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines, the foremost of which was the titanic silver mine at Potosí. When a family member died, which would usually happen within a year or two, the family would be required to send a replacement.The effects of smallpox on the Inca empire were even more devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Within a few years, smallpox claimed perhaps as much as 60% to 94% of the Inca population with other waves of European disease weakening them further. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Typhus (probably) in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, measles in 1618 – all ravaged the remains of Inca culture.Columbian ExchangeAfter Columbus’ arrival in the Americas, the animal, plant, and bacterial life of these two worlds began to mix. This process, first studied comprehensively by American historian Alfred Crosby, was called the Columbian Exchange. By reuniting formerly biologically distinct land masses, the Columbian Exchange had dramatic and lasting effects on the world. New diseases were introduced to American populations that had no prior experience of them. The results were devastating. These populations also were introduced to new weeds and pests, livestock, and pets. New food and fiber crops were introduced to Eurasia and Africa, improving diets and fomenting trade there. In addition, the Columbian Exchange vastly expanded the scope of production of some popular drugs, bringing the pleasures — and consequences — of coffee, sugar, and tobacco use to many millions of people. The results of this exchange recast the biology of both regions and altered the history of the world.The Flow from East to West: DiseaseBy far the most dramatic and devastating impact of the Columbian Exchange followed the introduction of new diseases into the Americas. When the first inhabitants of the Americas arrived across the Bering land bridge between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago, they brought few diseases with them. Why? For one reason, they had no domesticated animals, the original source of human diseases such as smallpox and measles. In addition, as they passed from Siberia to North America, the first Americans had spent many years in extreme cold, which eliminated many of the disease-causing agents that might have traveled with them. As a result, the first Americans and their descendants, perhaps 40 million to 60 million strong by 1492, enjoyed freedom from most of the infectious diseases that plagued populations in Afro-Eurasia for millennia. Meanwhile, in Asia and Africa, the domestication of herd animals brought new diseases spread by cattle, sheep, pigs, and fowl.Soon after 1492, sailors inadvertently introduced these diseases — including smallpox, measles, mumps, whooping cough, influenza, chicken pox, and typhus — to the Americas. People who lived in Afro-Eurasia had developed some immunities to these diseases because they had long existed among most Afro-Eurasian populations. However, the Native Americans had no such immunities. Adults and children alike were stricken by wave after wave of epidemic, which produced catastrophic mortality throughout the Americas. In the larger centers of highland Mexico and Peru, many millions of people died. On some Caribbean islands, the Native American population died out completely. In all, between 1492 and 1650, perhaps 90 percent of the first Americans had died.This loss is considered among the largest demographic disasters in human history. By stripping the Americas of much of the human population, the Columbian Exchange rocked the region’s ecological and economic balance. Ecosystems were in tumult as forests regrew and previously hunted animals increased in number. Economically, the population decrease brought by the Columbian Exchange indirectly caused a drastic labor shortage throughout the Americas, which eventually contributed to the establishment of African slavery on a vast scale in the Americas. By 1650, theslave tradehad brought new diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, which further plagued Native Americans.The Flow from East to West: Crops and AnimalsEurasians sent much more than disease westward. The introduction of new crops and domesticated animals to the Americas did almost as much to upset the region’s biological, economic, and social balance as the introduction of disease had. Columbus had wanted to establish new fields of plenty in the Americas. On his later voyages he brought many crops he hoped might flourish there. He and his followers brought the familiar food grains of Europe: wheat, barley, and rye. They also brought Mediterranean plantation crops such as sugar, bananas, and citrus fruits, which all had originated in South or Southeast Asia. At first, many of these crops fared poorly; but eventually, they all flourished. After 1640, sugar became the mainstay of the Caribbean and Brazilian economies, becoming the foundation for some of the largest slave societies ever known. The production of rice and cotton, both imported in the Columbian Exchange, together with tobacco, formed the basis of a slave society in the United States. Wheat, which thrived in the temperate latitudes of North and South America and in the highlands of Mexico, eventually became a fundamental food crop for tens of millions of people in the Americas. Indeed, by the late 20th century, wheat exports from Canada, the United States, and Argentina were feeding millions of people outside the Americas. It is true that the spread of these crops drastically changed the economy of the Americas. However, these new crops supported European settler societies and their African slave systems. Native Americans preferred their own foods.When it came to animals, however, the Native Americans borrowed eagerly from the Eurasian stables. The Columbian Exchange brought horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and a collection of other useful species to the Americas. Before Columbus, Native American societies in the high Andes had domesticated llamas and alpacas, but no other animals weighing more than 45 kg (100 lbs). And for good reason: none of the other 23 large mammal species present in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus were suitable for domestication. In contrast, Eurasia had 72 large animal species, of which 13 were suitable for domestication. So, while Native Americans had plenty of good food crops available before 1492, they had few domesticated animals. The main ones, aside from llamas and alpacas, were dogs, turkeys, and guinea pigs.Of all the animals introduced by the Europeans, the horse held a particular attraction. Native Americans first encountered it as a fearsome war beast ridden by Spanish conquistadors. However, they soon learned to ride and raise horses themselves. In the North American great plains, the arrival of the horse revolutionized Native American life, permitting tribes to hunt the buffalo far more effectively. Several Native American groups left farming to become buffalo-hunting nomads and, incidentally, the most formidable enemies of European expansion in the Americas.Cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats also proved popular in the Americas. Within 100 years after Columbus, huge herds of wild cattle roamed many of the natural grasslands of the Americas. Wild cattle, and, to a lesser degree, sheep and goats, menaced the food crops of Native Americans, notably in Mexico. Eventually, ranching economies emerged, based variously on cattle, goats, or sheep. The largest ranches emerged in the grasslands of Venezuela and Argentina, and on the broad sea of grass that stretched from northern Mexico to the Canadian prairies. Native Americans used livestock for meat, tallow, hides, transportation, and hauling. Altogether, the suite of domesticated animals from Eurasia brought a biological, economic, and social revolution to the Americas.The Flow from West to East: DiseaseIn terms of diseases, the Columbian Exchange was a wildly unequal affair, and the Americas got the worst of it. The flow of disease from the Americas eastward into Eurasia and Africa was either trivial or consisted of a single important infection. Much less is known about pre-Columbian diseases in the Americas than what is known about those in Eurasia. Based on their study of skeletal remains, anthropologists believe that Native Americans certainly suffered from arthritis. They also had another disease, probably a form of tuberculosis that may or may not have been similar to pulmonary tuberculosis common in the modern world. Native Americans also apparently suffered from a group of illnesses that included two forms of syphilis. One controversial theory asserts that the venereal syphilis epidemic that swept much of Europe beginning in 1494 came from the Americas; however, the available evidence remains inconclusive.The Flow from West to East: Crops and CuisineAmerica’s vast contribution to Afro-Eurasia in terms of new plant species and cuisine, however, transformed life in places as far apart as Ireland, South Africa, and China. Before Columbus, the Americas had plenty of domesticated plants. By the time Columbus had arrived, dozens of plants were in regular use, the most important of which were maize (corn), potatoes, cassava, and various beans and squashes. Lesser crops included sweet potato, papaya, pineapple, tomato, avocado, guava, peanuts, chili peppers, and cacao, the raw form of cocoa. Within 20 years of Columbus’ last voyage, maize had established itself in North Africa and perhaps in Spain. It spread to Egypt, where it became a staple in the Nile Delta, and from there to the Ottoman Empire, especially the Balkans. By 1800, maize was the major grain in large parts of what is now Romania and Serbia, and was also important in Hungary, Ukraine, Italy, and southern France. It was often used as animal feed, but people ate it too, usually in a porridge or bread. Maize appeared in China in the 16th century and eventually supplied about one-tenth of the grain supply there. In the 19th century it became an important crop in India. Maize probably played its greatest role, however, in southern Africa. There maize arrived in the 16th century in the context of the slave trade. Southern African environmental conditions, across what is now Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and eastern South Africa, suited maize handsomely. Over the centuries, maize became the primary peasant food in much of southern Africa. In late 20th-century South Africa, for example, maize grew in two-thirds to three-quarters of the region’s cropland.Despite maize’s success, the humble potato probably had a stronger impact in improving the food supply and in promoting population growth in Eurasia. The potato had little impact in Africa, where conditions did not suit it. But in northern Europe the potato thrived. It had the most significant effect on Ireland, where it promoted a rapid population increase until a potato blight ravaged the crop in 1845, bringing widespread famine to the area. After 1750, Scandinavia, the Low Countries, Germany, Poland, and Russia also gradually accepted the potato, which helped drive a general population explosion in Europe. This population explosion may have laid the foundation for world-shaking developments such as the Industrial Revolution and modern European imperialism. The potato also fed mountain populations around the world, notably in China, where it encouraged settlement of mountainous regions.While maize and potatoes had the greatest world-historical importance of the American crops, lesser crops made their marks as well. In West Africa, peanuts and cassava provided new foodstuffs. Cassava, a tropical shrub native to Brazil, has starchy roots that will grow in almost any soil. In the leached soils of West and Central Africa, cassava became an indispensable crop. Today some 200 million Africans rely on it as their main source of nutrition. Cacao and rubber, two other South American crops, became important export items in West Africa in the 20th century. The sweet potato, which was introduced into China in the 1560s, became China’s third most important crop after rice and wheat. It proved a useful supplement to diets throughout the monsoon lands of Asia. Indeed, almost everywhere in the world, one or another American food crops caught on, complementing existing crops or, more rarely, replacing them. By the late 20th century, about one-third of the world’s food supply came from plants first cultivated in the Americas. The modern rise of population surely would have been slower without them.In contrast, the animals of the Americas have had very little impact on the rest of the world, unless one considers its earliest migrants. The camel and the horse actually originated in North America and migrated westward across the Bering land bridge to Asia, where they evolved into the forms familiar today. By the time of the Columbian Exchange, these animals were long extinct in the Americas, and the majority of America’s domesticated animals would have little more than a tiny impact on Afro-Eurasia. One domesticated animal that did have an effect was the turkey. Wild animals of the Americas have done only a little better. Probably after the 19th century, North American muskrats and squirrels successfully colonized large areas of Europe. Deliberate introductions of American animals, such as raccoon fancied for their fur and imported to Germany in the 1920s, occasionally led to escapes and the establishment of feral animal communities. However, no species introduced from the Americas revolutionized human affairs or animal ecology anywhere in Afro-Eurasia. In terms of animal populations as with disease, the Americas contributed little that could flourish in the conditions of Europe, Africa, or Asia.TheRise of the Slave TradeEuropeans did not introduce slavery to Africa. As African rulers rose and fell, their political opponents, people of high social status, and their families were sold to promote internal political stability. Poor people were sold to reconcile debts owed by themselves or their families. Chiefs sold people as punishment for crimes. Gangs of Africans and a few marauding Europeans captured free Africans who were also sold into slavery. Domestic slaves were resold and prisoners of war were sold. Africans themselves carried out the capture and sale of other Africans for enslavement — few Europeans ever actually marched inland and captured slaves themselves.At the same time, had Europeans not wanted African slave labor for their American colonies, there would not have been any market for African slaves. African wars fed the slave trade, and the slave trade, in turn, fueled internal African wars. A. Adu Boahen, an African scholar, argues that “the greatest sources to supply slaves were raids conducted for the sole purpose of catching men for sale and above all, inter-tribal and inter-state wars which produced thousands of war captives, most of whom found their way to the New World.THE COST OF A SLAVEAll of these African people were bartered for European trade goods. A slave purchased for 100 gallons of rum worth only £10 could be sold for £20 to £50 in seventeenth-century America. The low cost of slaves greatly encouraged the slave trade. Even though the price of slaves rose three- or four-fold during the eighteenth century, many Europeans were convinced that it was “cheaper to buy than to breed.” In fact, until the late eighteenth century, it was cheaper to import a slave from Africa than to raise a child to the age of 14. During the late seventeenth century, merchants in the Senegambia region of West Africa paid as little as one pound sterling for young males, which they sold to European traders for the equivalent of three-and-a-half pounds sterling, or eleven muskets, thirty-one gallons of brandy, or ninety-three pounds of wrought iron. Initially, many slaves were acquired from regions within fifty or a hundred miles of the West African coast. During the eighteenth century, though, rising prices led slavers to search for captives in interior regions, 500 to 1,000 miles inland.WARS OVER SLAVERYAs the slave trade continued, more and more wars broke out between African principalities. Whatever the ostensible causes of these wars, they produced prisoners of war that supplied slave factories along the West and West Central African coast.The fighting between African societies followed a pattern. Wars weakened the centralized African governments and undermined the authority of associations, societies, and the elders who exercised social control in societies with decentralized political forms. Both winners and losers lost people from niches in lineages, secret societies, associations, guilds and other networks that maintained social order. Conflict brought about a loss of population and seriously compromised indigenous production of material goods, cash crops, and subsistence crops. Seventeenth-century Capuchin monks reported that the Angolan Ndongo slave catchment area was rapidly becoming a wasteland as countless people died in war or as slaves in transit to slaving depots, were exported as slaves, or fled the advance of slave-catching warriors.Both winners and losers in the African wars came to rely upon European trade goods. Eventually, European money replaced cowrie shells as a medium of exchange. European trade goods supplanted indigenous material goods, natural resources, and products as the economic basis of West African society. At the same time, Europeans increasingly required people in exchange for trade goods. Once this stage was reached, an African society had little choice but to trade human lives for European goods and guns — guns that had become necessary to wage wars for further captives in order to trade for goods upon which the African society was now dependent.The effects of the trade on African civilization and culture were devastating. African societies lost kinship networks and agricultural laborers and production capacity. The loss of people meant the loss of indigenous artisans and craftsmen along with their knowledge of textile production, weaving and dying, metallurgy and metalwork, carving, basket making, potting skills, architecture, and agricultural techniques upon which their societies depended. Africa’s loss was the New World’s gain. These were the same expertise and skills that Africans brought to the New World along with their physical labor and ability to acclimate to harsh environments that made them indispensable in the development of the new colonies and nations of the Western Hemisphere.Middle PassageThe Africans who had been stolen from their homes were placed onto ships that took them to South America, the Caribbean, or North America. This trip across the Atlantic Ocean was known as the Middle Passage. Conditions for the captured men, women and children aboard the ship were horrible. Up to a thousand people would have to survive for two to five months largely belowdeck, in quarters so tight that they could barely move. Besides being unbearably cramped, the deck had no ventilation, windows, or way to dispose of waste. Disease was rampant. Food was limited. Violence and torture were common. Equiano wrote:The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died.Those who did survive the Middle Passage were sold at auction upon arrival in their new country. These formerly free people were now enslaved, the property of another person.Slavery in the New WorldThe first Africans in America arrived in Jamestown, Virginia, as indentured servants in 1619. Indentured servants were laborers who were under contract, or indenture, to work for another person for a set number of years. When the contract expired, the laborer was free. Later, Africans brought to America arrived as slaves. Slaves were laborers who had no contract or rights and had to work for their owners for their entire lives. North Carolina adopted its first slave code — defining the social, economic, and physical places of enslaved people — in 1715; the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina approved in 1669 had made slavery acceptable. Enslaved people had been shipped directly from Africa to the colony as early as the 1680s, but because the coast was dangerous for large ships, most of North Carolina’s enslaved people were purchased from slave owners in Virginia or South Carolina. At the time of the American Revolution, most of the enslaved people in North Carolina lived in the eastern part of the colony and the majority lived on large plantations, where their work was critical to the state’s cash crops and economy.The long journeys of many enslaved people ended on large farms or plantations in the United States, like Stagville and Somerset in North Carolina — now State Historic Sites. On the plantation, the owner dictated much of their lives. Enslaved people were told what work to do, when to do it, and where to live. Harriet Jacobs (1813–1897), born into slavery on a plantation in Edenton, wrote a narrative in which she described many of the horrors endured by enslaved people, such as this instance of a family being separated:I saw a mother lead seven children to the auction-block. She knew that some of them would be taken from her; but they took all. The children were sold to a slavetrader, and their mother was bought by a man in her own town. Before night her children were all far away. She begged the trader to tell her where he intended to take them; this he refused to do. How could he, when he knew he would sell them, one by one, wherever he could command the highest price? I met that mother in the street, and her wild, haggard face lives today in my mind.The largest plantation in North Carolina was Stagville, established in 1787 by the Bennehan and Cameron families. Located in parts of what are now Orange, Durham, Wake, and Granville counties, Stagville in 1860 had more than nine hundred enslaved people living on its thirty thousand acres. Most of the people enslaved there worked in the fields growing crops such as tobacco, wheat, corn, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. Children as young as age seven were expected to work.At Stagville, there were two types of slave quarters. One style was a one-room house approximately fifteen feet square, in which an entire family would live. A more unique style of house was built on the plantation around 1850. These were two-story, four-room houses. One family of approximately five to seven people lived in each of the rooms. After they finished their labor for the owner, the enslaved people would return to these quarters to do their own work. Men would tend their gardens while women cooked a big meal that everyone would share. Children would help the adults with their work as well as doing their own chores, such as fetching water from the well, tending to the animals, or minding their younger siblings. Cy Hart, born into slavery at Stagville, was interviewed in the 1930s as part of a Works Progress Administration project. Discussing his life on the plantation, Hart said that he tended chickens and turkeys, and the other stock as he got older.After the work was done, the adults might tell the children stories or oral histories, help them make simple toys, or teach them games such asmancala. It was during this limited community time that the elders passed along African traditions to the next generation.Modern North Carolinians carry on these traditions. The people taken from their homes in Africa were not alone during their terrible journey on the Middle Passage. They carried memories of their culture, which they re-created in their new homes and which survives today. Many words Americans use today, such as daddy, buddy, banjo, gumbo, okra, and turnip, originate in West African languages. The last few words bring to mind foods that originated in West Africa. Other foods include field peas, gourds, and yams. Musical instruments such as banjos and drums also came from Africa.The United States banned further imports of slaves from Africa in 1808. Slavery would remain legal until the end of the Civil War in 1865, but from 1808 on, the slave population only grew through natural increase. If a person’s mother was enslaved, then that person was also enslaved. Based on the 1860 census, there were 361,522 African Americans (slave and free) living in North Carolina, as well as approximately 630,000 white people and slightly more than 1,100 American Indians.The Africans who were brought to the America hundreds of years ago overcame many difficulties to make this nation home. Thanks to their contributions and to those of their descendants, our nation is the richer.Video AssignmentWatch:The Atlantic slave trade: What too few textbooks told youby TED EdWatch:History vs. Christopher Columbusby TED EdInteractive Student Notebook AssignmentsThe Atlantic slave trade1.

31,6.1,"The European Renaissance, Italian and Northern","Map of Italian and Northern Renaissance cities.2 December 2015Student Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able to:Identifymajor causes and describe the major effects of the following important turning points in world history from 1450 to 1750: the rise of the Ottoman Empire, the influence of the Ming dynasty on world trade, European exploration and the Columbian Exchange, European expansion, and the Renaissance and the Reformation. [WH.1D]Explainthe political, intellectual, artistic, economic, and religious impact of the Renaissance. [WH.5A]Explainthe relationship among Christianity, individualism, and growing secularism that began with the Renaissance and how the relationship influenced subsequent political developments. [WH.25C]Identifysignificant examples of art and architecture that demonstrate an artistic ideal or visual principle from selected cultures. [WH.26A]European Renaissance, Italian and NorthernBeginning in the 1300’s, a reawakened interest in classical art and knowledge emerged in the city-states of northern Italy. A more secular society emerged, inspired by humanist ideas. The era would witness an explosion of artistic and intellectual innovation and creativity.The term Renaissance literally means ""rebirth."" It is the period in European civilization immediately following the Middle Ages. The Renaissance lasted from approximately 1300 to 1600, during which time Europe witnessed an explosion of creativity after a long period of decline and stagnation. This era thus marks the transition from medieval to modern times in Europe. It emerged first in the city-states of Italy, in particular, Florence, Rome, and Venice, and eventually spread north. Its primary characteristic was a reawakened interest in the classical art and knowledge of the Greeks and Romans.  Though the Western Roman Empire had suffered collapse during the Middle Ages, some Latin manuscripts survived within the monasteries, while scholars in the Eastern Roman empire, or Byzantium, had also managed to preserve classical writings.  The Arab world was also instrumental in helping to preserve and pass on classical texts.Renaissance interest in classical learning and art was more than just a fascination with ancient times, however.  It led to a new movement known ashumanismthat focused on secular, or worldly, themes rather than on the religious ideas that had concerned medieval thinkers.  Humanists believed in the idea of individualism that stressed the dignity and worth of the individual person and the importance of individual achievement.  Renaissance thinkers believed that people should work hard to improve themselves by developing their talents through many activities such as politics, sports, the arts, and most importantly, education. No wonder that the self-portrait and the autobiography became so popular during this era. According to a text from the period, the ideal Renaissance young man should be educated in the Greek and Roman classics, be charming, polite, and witty, be able to dance, write poetry, sing and play music.  He should be physically graceful and strong and be a skilled rider, wrestler, and swordsman.  Upper-class women of the Renaissance were also expected to be well educated in classical literature and to be able to write well, paint, make music, dance, and be charming.  The main difference in the expectations for men and women, however, was that a woman was not expected to seek fame as men did, and they were generally expected to inspire great poetry and art, not create it.  All things considered, most Renaissance women had less political, economic, and social influence than medieval women, even though they were certainly better educated.Humanists also encouraged enjoyment of worldly goods and pleasures. The wealthy openly enjoyed material luxuries, fine music, and tasty foods. Though most people remained devout Catholics, they believed a person could love and enjoy life without offending God, an attitude that would have shocked most people in medieval times. Medieval thinkers had often appeared to be consumed with guilt over sin and were constantly focused upon the need to obtain God's forgiveness for their ""wicked"" ways.  Humanists, on the other hand, celebrated everything human.  An individual's desire for fame and wealth, for example, was no longer considered sinful, but actually encouraged. People began to show greater interest in this world than in the life hereafter.Thus, a love for classical learning, the belief in self-improvement and achievement through many activities, especially education, and the enjoyment of secular pleasures are three important characteristics of the era. These three characteristics would be clearly reflected in the highly accomplished art of the period.  Some more biased observers of the Renaissance would claim that the level of artistic achievement realized during this period has never been surpassed.Italy’s AdvantagesWhile England and France were locked in the Hundred Years War, Italy had three advantages that fostered the Renaissance there: thriving cities, a wealthy merchant class, and the classical heritage of Greece and Rome.Italy was strategically located on the Mediterranean Sea where, ever since the Crusades, trade between Asia and Europe had increased. Italian cities emerged as centers of banking, commerce, and handicrafts. The Popes in Rome collected revenues from throughout Europe, and individual city-states ran their own affairs, collecting taxes and raising their own armies. Thus, while cities were emerging in northern Italy, the rest of Europe remained mostly rural. It is in cities where people have better opportunities to exchange new ideas, creating an ideal breeding ground for an intellectual revolution.Merchants became the wealthiest and most powerful class, and they came to dominate politics. Because they had to rely on their own wits, unlike nobles who inherited their social rank, they believed they deserved power and wealth because of their individual merit. This helped spur the Renaissance value of individualism. Renaissance Popes beautified Rome by spending large amounts of money for art. They, along with the wealthy merchant class becamepatronsof the arts by financially supporting artists. By having their portraits painted or by donating public art to the city, the wealthy demonstrated their own importance.Another reason that the Renaissance began in Italy is that artists and scholars drew inspiration from the ruins of Rome that surrounded them. They were impressed by the achievements of pre-Christian artists, thinkers, writers, and engineers. Like the Greeks, Renaissance thinkers believed in the power of human reason, observation, and experience to explain the world rather than simply relying on traditional Church teachings.A Revolution in ArtBefore the Renaissance, art in Italy was greatly influenced by Byzantine styles. Religious paintings were typically flat and lifeless. In the 1300’s, the painterGiottobegan creating an entirely new style that resulted in more depth and roundness to his figures. His figures showed emotion and gestures.[Figure 2]Giotto – Massacre of the InnocentsMasaccioand other artists experimented with ways to show three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. They developed the rules ofperspectiveto make objects appear to recede in the distance until they reached a vanishing point.[Figure 3]Masaccio - St Peter Healing the Sick with his ShadowDonatellomade sculpture more realistic by carving natural postures and expressions that reveal personality. With his statue,David, he created the first large, free-standing nude since ancient times.Donatello, the bronze David (1440s?) Museo Nazionale del Bargello h.158 cmLeonardo Da Vinciwas a painter, sculptor, inventor, engineer, and scientist. Thus, he is often referred to as the ideal “Renaissance man.” To understand human anatomy, he dissected human corpses. His notebooks include designs for a parachute, machine gun, war machines, and flying machines.Drawing of a Woman’s Torso-Leonardo da VinciThe original design of the giant crossbow (Codex Atlanticus, f. 149aAmong his many masterpieces, Leonardo painted theMona Lisa, which has been acclaimed as “the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world."" The sitter’s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpgLeonardo also paintedThe Last Supper, which captures the individual personalities and expressions of Jesus’ disciples after Jesus has announced that one of the will betray him.late 15th-century mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, MilanLike Leonardo,Michelangelocould be considered a true Renaissance man as well. He was a painter, sculptor, architect, and poet. He is best known for the way he portrayed the human body in painting and sculpture. Influenced by classical art, he created figures that are forceful and show heroic grandeur and power. By doing this, he explored the Renaissance theme of human potential. Three of his most famous works are his sculptings thePietaandDavidand hisfrescopaintings showing biblical scenes on the ceiling of theSistine Chapel. A fresco painting is a painting made on fresh plaster.The Pietà (1498–1499) is a work of Renaissance sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarroti, housed in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City.The painter,Raphael, studied the works of both Leonardo and Michelangelo. One of his favorite subjects was the Madonna and Child. He also filled the walls of Pope Julius II’s library with several paintings, one of these being theSchool of Athenswhich, as the title alone suggests, conveys classical influence on the Renaissance. In the painting influential teachers, thinkers, and artists from ancient, classical, and Renaissance figures are brought together.[Figure 10]The School of Athens, or Scuola di Atene in Italian, is one of the most famous frescoes by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511Renaissance Writers Change LiteratureRenaissance writers increasingly wrote in thevernacular, the everyday language of one’s homeland. While most serious poets of the age wrote in Latin,Dante AlighieriwroteThe Divine Comedyin Italian. For this reason he is sometimes called the creator of modern Italian. His example encouraged other poets to write in their own vernacular languages, such as England’s Geoffrey Chaucer and, later, Spain’s Cervantes and the English poet and dramatist,William Shakespeare, who many consider to be the greatest writer of all time.MachiavelliwroteThe Prince, a guidebook in how to secure and maintain political power. Machiavelli argued that most successful rulers were not those who acted according to laws or conscience, but those who were willing to do whatever was necessary to hold and maintain power. He argued that “the end justifies the means.” In other words, Machiavelli was not concerned with what was morally right but with what was politically effective.The Prince, is considered by many to be critical to the emergence of modern political science. His ideas mark the movement toward a more secular perspective of governing as opposed to the religious-based teachings of the Medieval Church.Renaissance writers were able to command a much wider audience because of a remarkable technological breakthrough, theprinting press.Johann Gutenbergpublished the first full-size book printed with movable type around 1455. For the first time, books were cheap enough that many Europeans could buy them. This encouraged the spread of new ideas, and more people began to learn to read.Interactive Notebook AssignmentsAssemble a portfolio of five European Renaissance artistic works (literary excerpts, paintings, sculpture, architecture) that reflect the changing ideas of the time.

The Reformation would help strengthen the power of secular rulers, paving the way for the emergence of the modern nation-state.By 1500, many forces had weakened the power of the Catholic Church. The most important of these forces were the new ideas of the Renaissance, the new technology of the printing press, and the increasing skepticism of Church authority generated from events such as the Great Schism and Black Death. There was also a growing awareness of widespread corruption with the Church. Many entered the clergy to gain power and wealth rather than because of faith. The Papacy experienced a growing loss of spiritual influence, as the Pope and members of the Church hierarchy acted more like secular princes than spiritual leaders. Church leaders were slow to respond to calls for reform.In the early 16thcentury the Church had fallen into the practice of sellingindulgences.Indulgences were pardons from punishment for committing a sin, allowing the sinner to enter Heaven. This practice brought in a great deal of revenue for the Church. The Pope was using money raised through the sale of indulgences to construct St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk, believed that neither priests nor the Pope had special powers, and he was deeply offended by the the selling of indulgences. In 1517, Luther postedNinety-Five Thesis, or statements, on a church door in Germany that challenged the Pop’s right to sell indulgences. Luther asserted that, “Those who believe that they can be certain of their salvation because they have indulgence letters will be eternally damned, together with their teachers.”[Figure 2]Martin Luther; (10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German friar, priest and professor of theology who was a seminal figure in the Protestant ReformationLuther’s Ninety-Five Thesis were more than just an attack on the selling of indulgences, however. Luther sought instead a full reform of the Church. His teachings rested on three main ideas:People could win salvation only by faith in God’s gift of forgiveness. (The Church taught that faithand“good works” – your behavior, practicing the sacraments of the Church, etc. - were needed for salvation).All Church teachings should be clearly based on the words of the Bible. The Pope and church traditions were false authorities.All people with faith were equal. Therefore, people did not need priests to interpret the Bible for them.Increasingly, the Pope realized that this monk was a serious threat. In one angry reply to Church criticism, Luther actually suggested that Christians drive the pope from the Church by force. In 1520, Pope Leo X issued a decree threatening Luther with excommunication unless he took back his statements. Instead, Luther gathered his students together around a bonfire in Wittenberg, Germany and threw the pope’s decree into the flames. LeoexcommunicatedLuther (expelled him from the Church).Luther was then summoned by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, a devout Catholic, to stand trial in the German city of Worms. There he confronted the Emperor and other representatives of the German states. When told torecant, or take back, his statements, Luther refused, responding,“I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not retract anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. I cannot do otherwise, here I stand, may God help me. Amen.”A month after Luther made this speech, Charles issued the Edict of Worms that declared Luther an outlaw and a heretic. Accordingly, no one in the empire was to give Luther food or shelter. All his books were to be burned.Luther, however, would be sheltered and protected within a castle by a powerful prince who supported his views. During the year Luther stayed here, he would translate the New Testament into the vernacular German. By the time he returned to Wittenberg in 1522, he discovered that many of his ideas were already being put into practice. Priests dressed in ordinary clothes and called themselves ministers. They led services in German instead of Latin. Some ministers had married, a practice not permitted to priests within the Catholic Church. With the New Testament now made available in German, each person could now read the Bible on his or her own. The reformers became known asProtestants, and many German princes adopted Protestantism. Eventually, the term Protestant was applied to Christians who belonged to non-Catholic churches. Instead of continuing to seek reforms within the Catholic Church, Luther and his followers become a separate religious group and established theLutheran Church, the first of the Protestant churches that would eventually be established.By 1524, German peasants, excited by Protestant talk of Christian freedom, demanded an end to serfdom. Bands of angry peasants went about the countryside raiding monasteries, pillaging, and burning. Luther, however, was horrified by the violence and sided with the Princes who had supported him, urging them to ruthlessly put down the revolt. Though he had attacked the Pope, he supported secular authority. As many as 100,000 people were massacred during this event known as the Peasant’s Revolt.While some German princes genuinely shared Luther’s beliefs liked Luther’s ideas for selfish reasons. They saw his teachings as a good excuse to seize Church lands and property and to assert their independence from Charles V. In 1529, German princes who remained loyal to the pope agreed to join forces against Luther’s ideas. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V led the war against the Protestant princes of Germany. Even though he defeated them in 1547, he failed to force them back into the Catholic Church.Weary of fighting, Charles ordered all German princes, both Protestant and Catholic, to assemble in the city of Augsburg. At that meeting, it was agreed that the churches in Germany could be either Lutheran or Catholic, but not Calvinist (see below). Furthermore, the prince of every state would decide the religion of his state. ThePeace of Augsburg(1555) temporarily ended the religious wars in Germany, though war would reignite later in the first half of the 17thcentury during the30 Years’ Warin which Germany would be ravaged. It is estimated that about 2/3rds of the German population perished or fled German during this conflict. Many died due to disease and starvation as armies burned and destroyed crops.While Catholics and Protestants fought each other on the continent, in England,King Henry VIIIhad become concerned that his Queen, Catherine of Aragon would not be able to give birth to a male heir. When the Pope refused his request to annul the marriage so that he could remarry, Henry broke with the Catholic Church, closed the English monasteries, and seized all Church lands. In 1534, Parliament passed theAct of Supremacy, which declared the English King, not the Pope, to be the official head of the English Church. To raise money, Henry sold much of the land he had seized to nobles and to members of England’s rising middle class. Suddenly there were many English landowners who stood to lose property if England returned to the Catholic Church. This group formed a solid base of support for the Protestant Reformation in England.Henry VIII (28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547) was King of England from 21 April 1509 until his deathIn most other ways, Henry remained more Catholic than Protestant. He insisted that English priests make no changes to Catholic rituals and doctrines. Henry, therefore, unlike Luther, broke ties with the Roman Catholic Church for political and personal reasons, not religious.InGeneva, SwitzerlandJohn Calvinstarted a new Protestant Church. Calvin taught that since God was all-knowing, it was predestined (already decided by God) who would be saved and who would be damned. While faith was the key to salvation, it was God who gave faith to some and denied it to others. Only the “Elect” would be saved. Such ideas encouraged hard work and a strict moral code. In Geneva, worldly success was interpreted as a sign of God’s favor.The Catholic Counter-ReformationAs Protestantism swept across many parts of Europe, the Catholic Church reacted by making limited reforms, curbing earlier abuses, and combating the further spread of Protestantism. This movement is known as theCatholic Counter-Reformation.Ignatius Loyola was one such leader of Catholic reform. He established the Society of Jesus whose members were commonly calledJesuitswho sought to defend and spread the Catholic faith. Stressing absolute discipline and obedience to the Pope, the Jesuits were like a spiritual army. They founded superb schools throughout Europe, converted non-Christians to Catholicism in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and were successful in preventing the further spread of Protestantism in areas such as Bavaria and Poland, which remain predominantly Catholic today primarily because of the effort of the Jesuits.In 1545, at the request of Pope Paul III, Catholic bishops and cardinals met at theCouncil of Trentand agreed on the following doctrines:The pope’s interpretation of the Bible was final. Any Christian who substituted his or her own interpretation was a heretic.Christians were not saved by faith alone, as Luther argued. They were saved by faith and good works.The Bible and Church tradition shared equal authority for guiding a Christian’s life.Indulgences, pilgrimages, and venerations of holy relics were all valid expressions of Christian piety, though the selling of indulgences was banned.The Church also drew up a list of books, theIndex of Forbidden Books, that were considered dangerous to the Catholic faith. Catholic bishops throughout Europe were ordered to gather up the offensive books, including Protestant Bibles, and burn them in great bonfires. The Church established theInquisition, a court whose purpose was to punishheretics(those who denied or contradicted Church teachings). Trials were held to examine, often by torture, those who denied or opposed Church teachings.The Impact of the ReformationBecause of the Reformation, religion no longer unified Europe. The Reformation tended to strengthen the power of secular rulers, paving the way for the emergence of the modern nation-state. In Protestant countries, people no longer had allegiance to the Pope: the secular ruler became the highest authority. In Catholic countries, the Church gave more power to secular rulers to help fight Protestantism. In general, France, Italy, Spain and Southern Germany remained Catholic. Northern Germany, England, Holland, and Scandinavia became Protestant. Finally, the reformers’ successful revolt against Church authority laid the groundwork for a rejection of Christian belief that occurred in Western culture in later centuries.Interactive Notebook AssignmentsCreate a feature news story about the Protestant Reformation.

33,6.3,The Scientific Revolution,"[Figure 1]Figure of the heavenly bodies — An illustration of the Ptolemaic geocentric system by Portuguese cosmographer and cartographer Bartolomeu Velho, 1568 (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris)Student Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able to:Identify major causes and describe the major effects of the following important turning points in world history from 1750 to 1914: the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment's impact on political revolutions. [WH.1E]Describe the origins of the Scientific Revolution in 16th century Europe and explain its impact on scientific thinking worldwide.[WH.27D]Identify the contributions of significant scientists such as  Copernicus, Galileo, Isaac Newton, and Robert Boyle.[WH.27E]Interpret and create written, oral, and visual presentations of social studies information. [WH.30C]Roots of the Scientific RevolutionThe beginning of the seventeenth century is known as the ""scientific revolution"" for the drastic changes evidenced in the European approach to science during that period. The word ""revolution"" connotes a period of turmoil and social upheaval where ideas about the world change severely and a completely new era of academic thought is ushered in. This term, therefore, describes quite accurately what took place in the scientific community following the sixteenth century. During the scientific revolution, medieval scientific philosophy was abandoned in favor of the new methods proposed by Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton; the importance of experimentation to the scientific method was reaffirmed; the importance of God to science was for the most part invalidated, and the pursuit of science itself (rather than philosophy) gained validity on its own terms. The change to the medieval idea of science occurred for four reasons:Seventeenth century scientists and philosophers were able to collaborate with members of the mathematical and astronomical communities to effect advances in all fields;Scientists realized the inadequacy of medieval experimental methods for their work and so felt the need to devise new methods (some of which we use today);Academics had access to a legacy of European, Greek, and Middle Eastern scientific philosophy they could use as a starting point (either by disproving or building on the theorems);Groups like the British Royal Society helped validate science as a field by providing an outlet for the publication of scientists' work.These changes were not immediate, nor did they directly create the experimental method used today, but they did represent a step toward Enlightenment thinking (with an emphasis on reason) that was revolutionary for the time. Assessment of the state of science before the scientific revolution, examination of the differences in the experimental methods utilized by different ""scientists"" during the seventeenth century, and exploration into how advances made during the scientific revolution affected the scientific method used in science today will provide an idea of how revolutionary the breakthroughs of the seventeenth century really were and what impact they've had.Science and Philosophy Before the RevolutionIn immediate contrast to modern times, only a few of Europe's academics at the beginning of the scientific revolution and the end of the sixteenth century considered themselves to be ""scientists. "" The words ""natural philosopher"" carried much more academic clout and so the majority of the research on scientific theory was conducted not in the scientific realm per se, but in philosophy, where ""scientific methods"" like empiricism and teleology were promoted widely.In the 17th century, empiricism and teleology existed as remnants of medieval thought that were utilized by philosophers such as William of Ockham, an empiricist (d. 1349), Robert Boyle, a 17th century chemist, teleologist and mechanist, and by the proponents of Plato and Aristotle (1st century teleologists and abstractionists). Both empiricism, as the theory that reality consists solely of what one physically experiences, and teleology, as the idea that phenomena exist only because they have a purpose (i.e. because God wills them to be so), generally negated the necessity of fact-gathering, hypothesis writing, and controlled experimentation that became such an integral part of modern chemistry and biology at the beginning of the 17th century. In other words, the study of science before the scientific revolution was so concentrated on philosophy (such as Aristotle's conception of ""ideas"" as ultimate truths) as to preclude the development of a scientific method that would necessitate the creation of an informed hypothesis to be tested.[Figure 2]The Shannon Portrait of the Hon. Robert Boyle F. R. S. (1627-1691). Robert Boyle (1627–1691), an Irish-born English scientist, was an early supporter of the scientific method and founder of modern chemistry. Boyle is known for his pioneering experiments on the physical properties of gases, his authorship of the Sceptical Chymist, his role in creating the Royal Society of London, and his philanthropy in the American colonies.The defining feature of the scientific revolution lies in how much scientific thought changed during a period of only a century, and in how quickly differing thoughts of different natural philosophers condensed to form a cohesive experimental method that chemists, biologists, and physicists can easily utilize today. The modern experimental method incorporates Francis Bacon's focus on use of controlled experiments and inductive reasoning, Galileo's emphasis on incorporation of established laws from all disciplines (math, astronomy, chemistry, biology, physics) in coming to a conclusion through mechanism, and Newton's method of composition, with each successive method strengthening the validity of the next.Francis Bacon (1561-1626)Bacon represents a first step away from sixteenth century thinking, in that he denied the validity of empiricism and preferred inductive reasoning (the method of deriving a general ""truth"" from observation of certain similar facts and principles) to the Aristotelian method of deductive reasoning (the method of using general principles to explain a specific instance, where the particular phenomena is explained through its relation to a ""universal truth"").Francis Bacon argued that the use of empiricism alone is insufficient, and thus emphasized the necessity of fact-gathering as a first step in thescientific method, which could then be followed by carefully recorded and controlled (unbiased) experimentation. Bacon largely differed from his sixteenth century counterparts in his insistence that experimentation should not be conducted to simply ""see what happens"" but ""as a way of answering specific questions. "" Moreover, he believed, as did many of his contemporaries, that a main purpose of science was the betterment of human society and that experimentation should be applied to hard, real situations rather than to Aristotelian abstract ideas. His experimental method of fact-gathering largely influenced advances in chemistry and biology through the 18th century.Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)Galileo argued that phenomena should be interpreted mechanically, meaning that because every phenomenon results from a combination of the most basic phenomena and universal axioms, if one applies the many proven theorems to the larger phenomenon, one can accurately explain why a certain phenomenon occurs the way it does. In other words, he argued that ""an explanation of a scientific problem is truly begun when it is reduced to its basic terms of matter and motion,"" because only the most basic events occur because of one axiom.For example, one can demonstrate the concept of ""acceleration"" in the laboratory with a ball and a slanted board, but to fully explain the idea using Galileo's reasoning, one would have to utilize the concepts of many different disciplines: the physics-based concepts of time and distance, the idea of gravity, force, and mass, or even the chemical composition of the element that is accelerating, all of which must be individually broken down to their smallest elements in order for a scientist to fully understand the item as a whole. This ""mechanic"" or ""systemic"" approach, while necessitating a mixture of elements from different disciplines, also partially removed the burden of fact-gathering emphasized by Bacon. In other words, through Galileo's method, one would not observe the phenomenon as a whole, but rather as a construct or system of many existing principles that must be tested together, and so gathering facts about the performance of the phenomenon in one situation may not truly lead to an informed observation of how the phenomenon would occur in a perfect circumstance, when all laws of matter and motion come into play. Galileo's experimental method aided advances in chemistry and biology by allowing biologists to explain the work of a muscle or any body function using existing ideas of motion, matter, energy, and other basic principles.Robert Boyle (1627-1691)Even though he made progress in the field of chemistry through Baconian experimentation (fact-finding followed by controlled experimentation), he remained drawn to teleological explanations for scientific phenomena. For example, Boyle believed that because God establish some rules of motion and nature, phenomena must exist to serve a certain purpose within that established order.Robert Hooke (1635-1703)Hooke, the Royal Society's first Curator of Experiments from 1662-1677, considered science as way of improving society. This was in contrast to medieval thought, where science and philosophy were done for knowledge's sake alone and ideas were tested just to see if it could be done. An experimentalist who followed the Baconian tradition, Hooke agreed with Bacon's idea that ""history of nature and the arts"" was the basis of science. He was also a leader in publicizing microscopy (not discovering, it had been discovered 30 years prior to his Micrographia).Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1747)He composed a set of four rules for scientific reasoning stated in his famed Principia. His analytical method was a critical improvement upon the more abstract approach of Aristotle, mostly because his laws lent themselves well to experimentation with mathematical physics, whose conclusions ""could then be confirmed by direct observation. "" Newton also refined Galileo's experimental method by creating the contemporary ""compositional method of experimentation"" that consisted in making experiments and observations, followed by inducted conclusions that could only be overturned by the realization of other, more substantiated truths. Essentially, through his physical and mathematical approach to experimental design, Newton established a clear distinction between ""natural philosophy"" and ""physical science. ""All of these natural philosophers built upon the work of their contemporaries, and this collaboration became even simpler with the establishment of professional societies for scientists that published journals and provided forums for scientific discussion.AstronomyThe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are notable for a significant shift in orientation toward the natural world. Previously, the study of nature had been dominated by the metaphysical speculations of Aristotle.In Aristotelian metaphysics, abstractions dominated. All entities were understood as following rules based on their essences. Each substance had a proper or natural place. In astronomy, space was divided into two main regions. The stars resided in the higher region and were fixed in space. The planets and the moon resided in the lower region and revolved around the Earth. The sun also revolved around the Earth. Celestial and earthly motion was understood in terms of bodies seeking their natural resting places.By the completion of the Scientific Revolution, most Aristotelian notions were overthrown. Space was reconceived as isotropic and non-hierarchical. Matter was seen as compositionally consistent throughout the universe. Motion was understood in terms of forces acting upon otherwise inert bodies. Finally, with Isaac Newton, a single constant called ""gravity"" was introduced as the fundamental operative force of the entire universe.CopernicusThe transformations in astronomy that took place during this period, which bore on cosmology, began with the work of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543). Copernicus was an extraordinary polymath, a master of numerous fields of study. He was a mathematician, lawyer, physician, and classicist. He was also a polyglot, a fluent speaker and writer in several languages, including Latin, Polish, German, Greek, and Italian. Most importantly for posterity, Copernicus was the astronomer credited with founding the field of modern astronomy.Copernicus's major work, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, was published in 1543, the year of his death. In this great work, Copernicus effected a radical transformation of the system developed byPtolemy(ca. 87–150 CE). Contrary to the Ptolemaic system, Copernicus posited a heliocentric model wherein the Earth and other planets, including Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, were carried by spheres around a stationary sun.[Figure 4]De revolutionibus, p. 9. Heliocentric model of the solar system in Copernicus' manuscriptIn the Ptolemaic system, the Earth had been figured as the stationary center of the universe around which the planets and sun revolved. In the Copernican system, on the other hand, the Earth was merely ""another planet,"" that is, a ""wandering star. ""Because his philosophy and theology held that God created only perfect order and harmony, Copernicus envisioned the planetary revolutions as perfectly circular. In order to account for some locations of planets and moons, he retained the auxiliary theory ofepicyclesthat had been a part of the Ptolemaic system. In Copernicus's use of epicycles, the planets also circled the Earth while circling the sun. The number of epicycles from the Ptolemaic system that Copernicus was able to eliminate is a subject of some disagreement.Like a majority of Europeans of his time, Copernicus was an adherent of the Catholic Church. Yet a heliocentric universe ran contrary to the Christian, Earth- centered cosmology.Accordingly, Copernicus withheld publication of On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres until he was literally on his deathbed. An introductory insertion in the text made by a friend or editor suggested that his writings ought to be understood as hypotheses only.While Copernicus's ideas were revolutionary at the time, they did not cause a revolution in the study of astronomy until taken up by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler several years later.[Figure 5]Jan Matejko-Astronomer Copernicus-Conversation with God Oil painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko, finished in 1873, depicting Nicolaus Copernicus observing the heavens from a balcony by a tower near the cathedral in Frombork.KeplerBut Kepler accomplished far more than the mere realization of the Copernican system. While accepting the central feature of Copernicus's model—a stationary sun and revolving planets—Kepler jettisoned the remainder of the complex and cumbersome auxiliary theories, including epicycles. In their place, he introduced a wholly new conception of the universe that is still essentially accepted today.Kepler was a student of Tycho Brahe, who is known for developing numerous instruments to improve the accuracy of astronomical observation. Kepler gained a great deal from his exposure to Tycho's methods and findings. His investigations of the planet Mars as a student of Tycho's effectively forced him to develop a theory that could account for the data. He drew from Tycho's yet unpublished notes and data to develop a picture of planetary positions that finally led to his major breakthrough, the accepted model of planetary motion. In his ""elliptical thesis,"" first propounded in his book The New Astronomy (1609), Kepler boldly declared that the planets, including the Earth, revolve around a stationary sun in ellipses, rather than in perfect circles.Kepler's other revolutionary contribution to astronomy was his introduction of a new celestial physics, one that aimed to explain the natural causes of the motions of celestial bodies. That is, with Kepler, we see the final overthrow of Aristotelian metaphysics, in which motion was based on the essence of the object itself. Under Aristotle's metaphysics, an object's movement toward its ""natural"" resting place accounted for its motion. Instead, Kepler introduced the modern notion of physical forces as the causes of motion. For Kepler, a planet or other lifeless object is without an internal or active force of its own. Motion is derived only from external forces acting on the object. This particular insight was essential for Isaac Newton's breakthrough formulation of the law of gravity.Video AssignmentExplain how is this bookan important step towards our modern understanding of the solar system.Interactive Notebook AssignmentsCreate a six-panel storyboard that chronicles how the new ideas introduced in the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment changed the world.

[WH.27C]Describe the origins of the Scientific Revolution in 16th century Europe and explain its impact on scientific thinking worldwide. [WH.27D]Absolutism in EuropeThe era of absolutism, exemplified by the ""Sun King"" Louis XIV Bourbon of France, marks the rise of rulers throughout Europe who had absolute power over their nations. Mercantilism became the primary form of economy of the day, and the issue of religion disappeared in European wars, now replaced by the issue of the balance of power.Louis XIV (1638-1715), Model of AbsolutismLouis XIV Bourbon of France rose to power in 1643. He was married to Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV. His power stemmed from the fact that during his reign he maintained a powerful, unified France. Louis and William III Stuart of Orange were arch-enemies during this time; however, Louis maintained the upper hand and was on the offensive against William during that time.Louis desired control over the Netherlands because of its economic power as a result of trade, because he wanted to crush Calvinists and Protestants, and because he desired increased territory. Indeed, he advised his heir, Louis XV, ""Do not imitate me in my taste for war."" His aggressive policy demanded to finance the largest European army of 280,000 men.Louis' wars resulted in horrendous results and poverty for the French people, and Protestants despised Louis. His economic policy was headed by Colbert, and his nation was a model in enacting mercantilism. During his reign, France became the dominant country in language, culture, and dress.Louis allegedly famously declared, ""L'etat c'est moi,"" or ""I am the state,"" and his reign exemplifies absolutism. French Bishop Bossuet declared that it was the divine right of monarchs to rule, concluding that kings were God's anointed representatives on earth. Louis acted upon this belief, governing France as if he were placed on earth by God to rule.Overall, Louis' foreign goals were territorial expansion and the spread of Catholicism.Louis was highly successful in his domestic ambitions to achieve absolute power through centralized bureaucracy. He successfully controlled rebellious nobles and made himself the center of French power and culture. People depended upon him for advancement and thrived on his goodwill. Louis also established the palace at Versailles, which took fourteen years to construct. Versailles was modeled by every other major European country, and it successfully kept nobles occupied, distracting them from the desire to have a say in government. In 1685, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes, stripping Calvinists of their rights in France.[Figure 1]Louis XIV King of France and of Navarre By Hyacinthe Rigaud (1701)Divine Right of KingsLouis, as other monarchs in kingdoms such as Russia and Spain, based his rulership on a concept known as divine right of kings. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the rise of the nation-state and the protestant reformation, the theory of divine right was used to justify the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. This theory came to be used in England under the reign of the stuart monarchs, James I (1603-1625)and Charles I (1625-1649), but never gained traction and was discredited in the aftermath of the English Civil War[Figure 2]Portrait of Charles I.English Civil War (1642-1651)The English Civil War in response to the behavior of the Stuart monarchs, particularly Charles I, in dealing with Parliament as well as the extravagant lifestyle of both monarchs. Furthermore, Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father. Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move, because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as ""little gods on Earth"", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the ""Divine Right of Kings""), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification. Finally, many members of Parliament, a significant portion of whom were members of reformed Protestant churches such as the Puritans or Calvinists, distrusted Charles' motives thanks to his religious policies and the fact he was married to a Roman Catholic. His support of the high ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, as well as his failure to successfully aid Protestant forces in the Thirty Years' War further damage his ability to govern.From 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. In 1660, the English Interregnum ended when the monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II.Thomas Hobbes, a philosopher who lived through the violence and chaos of the English civil war, was alarmed by the revolutionary upheaval in England. He wroteLeviathanwas published in 1651.Hobbes claimed that before society was organized humans led a “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” existence. Humans were guided not by reason and morals but instead by a struggle for self-preservation.To stop people from destroying each other, people created the idea of the social contract and agreed to form a state. Hobbes referred to the state as a great Leviathan that is responsible for peace and defense.  Furthermore, Hobbes argued people in the state agreed to be governed by an absolute ruler who possessed unlimited power. Rebellion in his view should be suppressed. Hobbes believed absolute power was needed to preserve the social order.The EnlightenmentThe Enlightenment was a philosophical movement in the eighteenth century composed of intellectuals who were greatly impressed with the achievements of the Scientific Revolution. They were very much concerned with the idea of reason, meaning the application of the scientific method to help understand all of life. They hoped that by using the scientific method, they could make progress toward a better society than the one they had inherited.Reason, natural law, hope, progress—these were common words to the thinkers of the time.The Enlightenment was especially influenced by the ideas of two seventeenth-century Englishmen, Isaac Newton and John Locke. To Newton, the physical world and everything in it was like a giant machine (the Newtonian world-machine). If you could discover the natural laws that governed the physical world, then it was possible to discover the natural laws that governed human society.John Locke’s theory of knowledge also greatly affected eighteenth-century intellectuals. In hisEssay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke argued that every person was born with a blank mind (known as table rasa). Furthermore, he suggested that people were molded by the experiences they gained from the world around themJohn Locke's Kit-cat portrait by Godfrey Kneller, National Portrait Gallery, LondonMontesquieuCharles-Louis de Secondat, the Baron de Montesquieu, was a French noble.His most famous work,The Spirit of the Laws, was published in 1748. In this study of government he tried to use the scientific method to find the natural laws that govern the social and political relationships of human beings.Thus, in his work Montesquieu identified three basic kinds of governments: a. republics, suitable for small states; b. despotisms, ideal for large states; and c. monarchies, appropriate for moderate sized states.Montesquieu believed that England’s government had three branches: the executive (the monarch), the legislative (parliament) and the judicial (the courts of law). This government functioned through what is known as the separation of powers. By separating the powers of each branch, Montesquieu believed that each one would act as a check on the other. Because it prevents any one person or group from gaining too much power, he argued this system provides the greatest amount of freedom and security, not for the people, but for the state.RousseauBy the mid-eighteenth century, a new group of philosophers had come of age. The most famous of this later generation was a man named Jean-Jacques Rousseau. As a young man he wandered France and Italy holding various jobs. Eventually, he found himself in Paris where he became a member of the circle of philosophes.In hisDiscourse on the Origins of the Inequality of Mankind,he argued that people adopted laws and government in order to preserve their private property. In the process of doing so, however, they had become enslaved by the government. What then, should people do in order to regain their freedom and throw off the chains of bondage?In a famous work published in 1762 titledThe Social Contract, Rousseau presented his concept of the social contract. Through this device an entire society agrees to be governed by the general will. If an individual wishes to follow his/her own self-interest, they must be forced to abide by the will of the majority. “This means nothing less than that [they] will be forced to be free,” said Rousseau. Therefore, according to Rousseau, liberty is achieved by being forced to follow what is best for the general will because it is what is best for the community at large.Interactive Notebook AssignmentsCreate a six-panel storyboard that chronicles how the new ideas introduced in the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment changed the world.

[WHS.20B]Describehow people have participated in supporting or changing their governments. [WHS.21A]Democratic RevolutionBetween 1760 and 1800, the American colonists cast off British rule to create a new nation and a radically new form of government based on the idea that people have the right to govern themselves. After having become accustomed to virtual self-government for over a century, the British became more involved after theFrench and Indian war. The colonists saw British interference into their affairs as denying them the same rights they possessed as any other British subject. The revolution would transform a monarchical society, in which the colonists were subjects of the Crown, into a republic, in which they were citizens and participants in the political process. Above all, the Revolution popularized certain radical ideals, especially a commitment to liberty, equality, government of the people, and rule of law. However compromised in practice, these egalitarian ideals inspired a spirit of reform that would continue to influence the evolution of the new republic.For well over a century, the English colonists who had settled in North America had been mostly left alone to govern their own affairs, which included their own locally controlled colonial assemblies. This British policy of salutary neglect would all change beginning with the Seven Years War. Also known as theFrench and Indian Warit was  a conflict fought between Britain and France from 1754 to 1763 for colonial dominance of North America. This war ended after the British captured most of France’s major cities and forts in Canada and the OhioValley.In 1763, in the interest of maintaining a more peaceful coexistence between the colonists and Indians along the western frontier, Parliament issued the Proclamation of 1763, forbidding American colonists to settle on Native American territory unless native rights to the land had first been obtained by purchase or treaty. This policy, which essentially prohibited settlement in the West, irritated the colonists. An even more contentious problem, however, was Britain’s need for money, due in no small part to the great expense of fighting the French and Indian War, and for the further support of the empire.Britain’s past policy of salutary neglect was coming to an end.Prime Minister George Grenville began enforcing the ancient Navigation Acts in 1764, passed the Sugar Act to tax sugar, and passed the Currency Act to remove paper currencies from circulation. A year later, he passed theStamp Act, which placed a tax on printed materials, and theQuartering Act, which required Americans to house and feed British troops.The Sugar Act was the first fully enforced tax levied in America solely for the purpose of raising revenue. Americans throughout the thirteen colonies cried out against“taxation without representation”and made informal non-importation agreements of certain British goods in protest. Several colonial leaders convened theStamp Act Congressin New York to petition Parliament and King George III to repeal the tax. In 1766, Parliament bowed to public pressure and repealed the Stamp Act. But it also quietly passed the Declaratory Act, which stipulated that Parliament reserved the right to tax the colonies anytime it chose.In 1767, Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, which levied another series of taxes on lead, paints, and tea known as the Townshend Duties. In the same series of acts, Britain passed the Suspension Act, which suspended the New York assembly for not enforcing the Quartering Act. To prevent violent protests, Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson requested assistance from the British army, and in 1768, four thousand redcoats landed in the city to help maintain order. However, on March 5, 1770, an angry mob clashed with several British troops. Five colonists died, and news of theBoston Massacrequickly spread throughout the colonies.[Figure 2]Paul Revere’s historic engraving, The Bloody Massacre in King-Street, was probably the most effective piece of war propaganda in American history, though a very inaccurate depiction of the actual event.In 1773, Parliament passed theTea Act, granting the financially troubled British East India Company a trade monopoly on the tea exported to the American colonies. In many American cities, tea agents resigned or canceled orders, and merchants refused consignments in response to the unpopular act. Governor Hutchinson of Massachusetts, determined to uphold the law, ordered that three ships arriving in Boston harbor should be allowed to deposit their cargoes and that appropriate payments should be made for the goods. On the night of December 16, 1773, while the ships lingered in the harbor, sixty men boarded the ships, disguised as Native Americans, and dumped the entire shipment of tea into the harbor. That event is now famously known as theBoston Tea Party.In January 1774, Parliament passed theCoercive Acts, also known as the Intolerable Acts, which shut down Boston Harbor until the British East India Company had been fully reimbursed for the tea destroyed in theBoston Tea Party.To protest the Intolerable Acts, prominent colonials gathered in Philadelphia atthe First Continental Congressin autumn of 1774. They once again petitioned Parliament, King George III, and the British people to repeal the acts and restore friendly relations. For additional motivation, they also decided to institute aboycott, or ban, of all British goods in the colonies.“The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor”On April 19, 1775, part of the British occupation force in Boston marched to the nearby town of Concord, Massachusetts, to seize a colonial militia arsenal. Militiamen ofLexington and Concordintercepted them and attacked. The first shot—the so-called “shot heard round the world” made famous by poet Ralph Waldo Emerson—was one of many that hounded the British and forced them to retreat to Boston. Thousands of militiamen from nearby colonies flocked to Boston to assist.In the meantime, leaders convened theSecond Continental Congressto discuss options. In one final attempt for peaceful reconciliation, theOlive Branch Petition, they professed their love and loyalty to King George III and begged him to address their grievances. The king rejected the petition and formally declared that the colonies were in a state of rebellion.In January of 1776,Thomas Painepublished a pamphlet,Common Sensethat urged the colonists to declare and fight for independence. The pamphlet explained the advantages of and the need for immediate independence in clear, simple language. It was published anonymously and became an immediate sensation. It was sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places. Common Sense presented the American colonists with an argument for freedom from British rule at a time when the question of whether or not to seek independence was the central issue of the day.TheSecond Continental CongresschoseGeorge Washington, a southerner, to command the militiamen besieging Boston in the north. They also appropriated money for a small navy and for transforming the undisciplined militias into the professional Continental Army. Encouraged by a strong colonial campaign in which the British scored only narrow victories (such as at Bunker Hill), many colonists began to advocate total independence as opposed to having full rights within the British Empire. The next year, the congressmen voted on July 2, 1776, to declare their independence.Thomas Jefferson, a young lawyer from Virginia, drafted theDeclaration of Independence,a document firmly based on the ideas of the English philosopher,John Locke, and the Enlightenment. The Declaration reflected these ideas in its eloquent argument for natural rights:“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that at all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator withunalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness; that to guarantee these Rights governments are Instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.”Since Locke had asserted that people have the right to rebel against an unjust ruler, the Declaration of Independence included a long list of George III’s abuses. The document ended by breaking the ties between the colonies and Britain. The colonies, the Declaration said, “are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown.John Trumbull - ""Declaration of Independence” 1819""When war was first declared, the odds seemed heavily weighted against the Americans. Washington’s ragtag, poorly trained army faced the well-trained forces of the most powerful country in the world. And yet, the Americans had advantages. First, the Americans’ motivation for fighting was much stronger than that of theBritish,since their army was defending their homeland. Second, the overconfident British generals made several mistakes. Third, time itself was on the side of the Americans. The British could win battle after battle, as they did, and still lose the war. Fighting an overseas war, 3,000 miles from London, was terribly expensive. After a few years, tax-weary British citizens clamored for peace. Finally, the Americans did not fight alone. Louis XVI of France had little sympathy for the ideals of theAmerican Revolution, but he was eager to weaken France’s rival, Britain. French entry into the war in 1778 was decisive. In 1781, combined forces of about 9,500 Americans and 7,800 French trapped a British army commanded by Lord Cornwallis nearYorktown,Virginia. Unable to escape, Cornwallis surrendered. In the end, the Americans won their war for independence.Americans Create a RepublicThe new U.S.Constitutioncreated a system in which power was shared between the national government and state governments. The Constitution further divided the three different types of government powers – legislative, executive, and judicial – among three separate branches of government, as advocated by the Enlightenment thinker Baron de Montesquieu.In addition, the new Constitution gave each of these government branches several ways to “check” the other branches (known as the system of“checks and balances”) in order to ensure that no one branch became too powerful or tyrannical. Later, aBill of Rightswas added to the Constitution to include protections of individual liberties such as freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion, as well as the rights of the accused.Although the Constitution created a strong central government, it did not eliminate local governments. Instead, the Constitution established the practice offederalism, in which power would be divided between national and state governments.The Constitution and Bill of Rights marked a turning point in people’s ideas about government. Both documents put Enlightenment ideas into practice. They expressed an optimistic view that reason and reform could prevail and that progress was inevitable.

By the time the dust had settled, theFrench Revolutionand the successive events it gave birth too would bring about significant changes to not only France, but to the rest of the European continent and beyond. The revolution and the events that soon followed would abolish serfdom and feudal privileges, create a uniform system of local government, lay the groundwork for a national education system, generate a new legal code, abolish slavery in the colonies, and establish a standardized metric system. The ideal, if not the practice, of constitutional government would been rooted in the French mind. Most importantly, the seeds of liberalism, constitutionalism, and democracy had been sewn. The most striking result of the Revolution in its own time was its violent disturbance of old orders; from Ireland to Poland, nothing would ever be the same again.What caused the French Revolution? by TED EdThe Old RegimeToward the end of the 18th century, years of feudal oppression and fiscal mismanagement contributed to a French society that was ripe for revolt. TheOld Regimein France was the system of feudalism left over from the Middle Ages. It was divided into three classes or “estates.” TheFirst Estatewas the clergy, consisting of priests and Church officials. It owned about 10% of the land in France and contributed about 2% of its income to the government. TheSecond Estatewas the nobility. The nobles held many special privileges, such as being exempt from many taxes and having the right to collect feudal dues. Nobles also served as officers in the army and held high positions at court. Though the Second Estate only made up about 2% of the population it owned 20% of the land.TheThird Estate, was the largest of the three estates, making up about 98% of the French population. The three groups that made up this estate differed greatly in their economic conditions.The first group – the bourgeoisie – were merchants and artisans. They were well-educated and believed strongly in the Enlightenment ideals of liberty and equality. Although some of the bourgeoisie were as rich as nobles, they paid high taxes and lacked privileges of the Second Estate. Many felt that their wealth entitle them to a greater degree of social status and political power.The workers of France’s cities – cooks, servants, and others – formed the second group within the Third Estate, a group poorer than the bourgeoisie. The poor of France’s cities often went hungry. Most of Paris’ poor people ate three pounds of bread a day and very little else. If the cost of bread rose, hungry mobs attacked carts of grain and bread to steal what they needed. In 1788, grain harvests were small. The price of bread doubled. Thus, the sans-culottes, as France’s city workers were called, were in a dangerous mood in the spring of 1789.Peasants formed the largest group within the Third Estate – more than 80% of France’s 26 million people. Peasants paid about half their income in dues to nobles, tithes to the church, and taxes to the king’s agents. They even paid taxes on such basic staples a salt. Peasants joined the urban poor in resenting the clergy and the nobles for their privileges and special treatment. Collectively, therefore, each of the heavily taxed and discontented groups within the Third Estate were eager for change.[Figure 2]The Three Estates of France: ""You should hope that this game will be over soon."" The Third Estate carrying the Clergy and the Nobility on its backEnlightenment ideas made many Frenchmen unwilling to accept the divine right of kings and the privileged position of the Church and nobility. The success of the American Revolution inspired them, and they discussed the radical ideas of Rousseau and Voltaire.Against this backdrop,France’s once prosperous economy was failing. The population was expanding rapidly, as were trade and production. However, the heavy burden of taxes made it impossible to conduct business profitably within France. The cost of living rose for everyone. In addition, bad weather in the 1780’s caused widespread crop failures, resulting in a severe shortage of grain, and many people faced starvation.During this period,France’s government sank deeply into debt. Extravagant spending by the king and queen was part of the problem.Louis XVI, who became king in 1774, inherited part of the debt from his predecessors. He also borrowed heavily in order to help the American revolutionaries in their war against Great Britain–France’s chief rival – thereby nearly doubling the government’s debt. When bankers in 1786 refused to lend the government any more money, Louis faced serious problems.Unfortunately,Louis XVIwas a weak and indecisive leader who allowed matters to drift. He paid little attention to the details of governing and preferred to hunt and tinker with locks. His wife, Marie Antoinette was unpopular and became known as Madame Deficit because of her extravagant purchases of gowns, jewels and gifts. Rather than cutting expenses and increasing taxes, Louis put off dealing with the emergency until France faced bankruptcy.[Figure 3]Antoine-François Callet: Louis XVIThe Estates-GeneralIn an act of desperation, Louis XVI decided in 1789 to convene the Estates-General, an ancient assembly consisting of three different estates that each represented a portion of the French population. If the Estates-General could agree on a tax solution, it would be implemented. However, since two of the three estates—the clergy and the nobility—were tax-exempt, the attainment of any such solution was unlikely.Moreover, the outdated rules of order for the Estates-General gave each estate a single vote, despite the fact that the Third Estate—consisting of the general French public—was many times larger than either of the first two. Feuds quickly broke out over this disparity and would prove to be irreconcilable. Realizing that its numbers gave it an automatic advantage, the Third Estate declared itself the sovereign National Assembly. Within days of the announcement, many members of the other two estates had switched allegiances over to this revolutionary new assembly.The Bastille and the Great FearShortly after the National Assembly formed, its members took the Tennis Court Oath, swearing that they would not relent in their efforts until a new constitution had been agreed upon. TheNational Assembly’s revolutionary spirit galvanized France, manifesting in a number of different ways. In Paris, citizens stormed the city’s largest prison, the Bastille, in pursuit of arms. In the countryside, peasants and farmers revolted against their feudal contracts by attacking the manors and estates of their landlords. Dubbed the “Great Fear,” these rural attacks continued until the early August issuing of the August Decrees, which freed those peasants from their oppressive contracts. Shortly thereafter, the assembly released theDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which established a proper judicial code and the autonomy of the French people. Reflecting the influence of Enlightenment ideas and of the Declaration of Independence, the document state that “men are born and remain free and equal in rights” and that “the aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural….rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.” Other articles of the famous document guaranteed citizens equal justice, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion.“Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”became the slogan of the Revolution.The Storming of the Bastille, July 14, 1789Rifts in the AssemblyThough the National Assembly did succeed in drafting a constitution, the relative peace of the moment was short-lived. A rift slowly grew between the radical and moderate assembly members, while the common laborers and workers began to feel overlooked. Meanwhile, Louis and his family tried to escape from France to the Austrian Netherlands but were caught. Returned to Paris under armed guard, Louis’ attempted escape only served to increase the influence of his radical enemies, sealing his own doom. The assembly became especially divided. The moderate Girondins took a stance in favor of retaining the constitutional monarchy, while the radical Jacobins wanted the king completely out of the picture.Outside of France, some neighboring countries feared that France’s revolutionary spirit would spread beyond French land. In response, they issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which insisted that the French return Louis XVI to the throne. French leaders interpreted the declaration as hostile, so the Girondin-led assembly declared war on Austria and Prussia.The Reign of TerrorThe first acts of the newly named National Convention were the abolition of the monarchy and the declaration of France as a republic. In January 1793, the convention tried and executed Louis XVI on the grounds of treason. Despite the creation of theCommittee of Public Safety, the war with Austria and Prussia went poorly for France, and foreign forces pressed on into French territory. Enraged citizens overthrew the Girondin-led National Convention, and the Jacobins, led byMaximilien Robespierre, took control.Backed by the newly approved Constitution of 1793, Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety began conscripting French soldiers and implementing laws to stabilize the economy. For a time, it seemed thatFrance’s fortunes might be changing. But Robespierre, growing increasingly paranoid about counterrevolutionary influences, embarked upon aReign of Terrorin late 1793–1794, during which he had more than 15,000 people executed at the guillotine. When the French army successfully removed foreign invaders and the economy finally stabilized, however, Robespierre no longer had any justification for his extreme actions, and he himself was arrested in July 1794 and executed.The Thermidorian Reaction and the DirectoryThe era following the ousting of Robespierre was known as the Thermidorian Reaction, and a period of governmental restructuring began, leading to the new Constitution of 1795 and a significantly more conservative National Convention. To control executive responsibilities and appointments, a group known as the Directory was formed. Though it had no legislative abilities, the Directory’s abuse of power soon came to rival that of any of the tyrannous revolutionaries France had faced.NapoleonMeanwhile, the Committee of Public Safety’s war effort was realizing unimaginable success. French armies, especially those led by young generalNapoleon Bonaparte, were making progress in nearly every direction. Napoleon’s forces drove throughItaly and reached as far as Egypt before facing a deflating defeat. In the face of this rout, and having received word of political upheavals in France, Napoleon returned to Paris. He arrived in time to lead a coup against the Directory in 1799, eventually stepping up and naming himself “first consul”—effectively, the leader of France. With Napoleon at the helm, the Revolution ended, and France entered a fifteen-year period of military rule.Napoleon worked to restore stability to post-revolutionary France. He centralized the government; instituted reforms in such areas as banking and education; supported science and the arts; and sought to improve relations between his regime and the pope (who represented France’s main religion, Catholicism), which had suffered during the revolution. One of his most significant accomplishments was the Napoleonic Code, which streamlined the French legal system and continues to form the foundation of French civil law to this day.In 1802, a constitutional amendment made Napoleon first consul for life. Two years later, in 1804, he crowned himself emperor of France in a lavish ceremony at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.From 1803 to 1815, France was engaged in theNapoleonic Wars, a series of major conflicts with various coalitions of European nations. In 1803, partly as a means to raise funds for future wars, Napoleon sold France’s Louisiana Territory in North America to the newly independent United States for $15 million, a transaction that later became known as theLouisiana Purchase.In October 1805, the British wiped out Napoleon’s fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar. However, in December of that same year, Napoleon achieved what is considered to be one of his greatest victories at the Battle of Austerlitz, in which his army defeated the Austrians and Russians. The victory resulted in the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine.Beginning in 1806, Napoleon sought to wage large-scale economic warfare against Britain with the establishment of the so-called Continental System of European port blockades against British trade. In 1807, following Napoleon’s defeat of the Russians at Friedland in Prussia, Alexander I (1777-1825) was forced to sign a peace settlement, the Treaty of Tilsit. In 1809, the French defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Wagram, resulting in further gains for Napoleon. During these years, Napoleon reestablished a French aristocracy (eliminated in the French Revolution) and began handing out titles of nobility to his loyal friends and family as his empire continued to expand across much of western and central continental Europe.Napoleon’s Downfall and First AbdicationIn 1810, Russia withdrew from the Continental System. In retaliation, Napoleon led a massive army into Russiain the summer of 1812. Rather than engaging the French in a full-scale battle, the Russians adopted a “scorched-earth” strategy of retreating whenever Napoleon’s forces attempted to attack. As a result, Napoleon’s troops trekked deeper into Russia despite being ill-prepared for an extended campaign. In September, both sides suffered heavy casualties in the indecisive Battle of Borodino. Napoleon’s forces marched on to Moscow, only to discover almost the entire population evacuated. Retreating Russians set fires across the city in an effort to deprive enemy troops of supplies. After waiting a month for a surrender that never came, Napoleon, faced with the onset of the Russian winter, was forced to order his starving, exhausted army out of Moscow. During the disastrous retreat, his army suffered continual harassment from a suddenly aggressive and merciless Russian army. Of Napoleon’s 600,000 troops who began the campaign, only an estimated 100,000 made it out of Russia.At the same time as the catastrophic Russian invasion, French forces were engaged in thePeninsular War(1808-1814), brought about by Napoleon’s attempt to put his brother which resulted in the Spanish and Portuguese, with assistance from the British, driving the French from the Iberian Peninsula. This loss was followed in 1813 by the Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations, in which Napoleon’s forces were defeated by a coalition that included Austrian, Prussian, Russian and Swedish troops. Napoleon then retreated to France, and in March 1814 coalition forces captured Paris.On April 6, 1814, Napoleon, then in his mid-40s, was forced to abdicate the throne. With the Treaty of Fontainebleau, he was exiled to Elba, a Mediterranean island off the coast of Italy. He was given sovereignty over the small island, while his wife and son went to Austria.Hundred Days Campaign and Battle of WaterlooOn February 26, 1815, after less than a year in exile, Napoleon escapedElbaand sailed to the French mainland with a group of more than 1,000 supporters. On March 20, he returned toParis, where he was welcomed by cheering crowds. The new king, Louis XVIII (1755-1824), fled, and Napoleon began what came to be known as his Hundred Days campaign.Upon Napoleon’s return to France, a coalition of allies–the Austrians, British, Prussians and Russians–who considered the French emperor an enemy began to prepare for war. Napoleon raised a new army and planned to strike preemptively, defeating the allied forces one by one before they could launch a united attack against him.In June 1815, his forces invaded Belgium, where British and Prussian troops were stationed. On June 16, Napoleon’s troops defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. However, two days later, on June 18, at theBattle of Waterloonear Brussels, the French were crushed by the British, with assistance from the Prussians. On June 22, 1815, Napoleon was once again forced to abdicate. In October 1815, Napoleon was exiled to the remote, British-held island of Saint Helena, in the South Atlantic Ocean. He died there onMay 5, 1821, at age 51, most likely from stomach cancer.Without a doubt, Napoleon was a military genius and a brilliant administrator. Yet all his victories must be measured against the millions of lives that were lost in his wars. Of his many achievements, only his aw code and some of his reforms in France’s government proved lasting – and they were not won on the battlefield. A later French statesman and writer, Alexis de Tocqueville, summed up Napoleon’s character by saying, “he was as great as a man can be without virtue.” Napoleon’s defeat opened the door for the freed European countries to establish a new order.The Congress of ViennaAfter Napoleon’s first defeat in 1814, leaders of many nations met for months. They tried to draw up a peace plan for Europe that would last many years. They called the meeting theCongress of Vienna. The key person there was the foreign minister of Austria, Klemens von Metternich. He shaped the peace conditions that were eventually accepted.Metternich insisted on three goals. First, he wanted to make sure that the French would not attack another country again. Second, he wanted abalance of powerin which no one nation was too strong. Third, he wanted to put kings back in charge of the countries from which they had been removed. The leaders agreed with Metternich’s ideas. An age of European peace began.AcrossEurope, kings and princes reclaimed their thrones. Most of them were conservatives and did not encourage individual liberties. They did not want any calls for equal rights. However, many people still believed in the ideals of the French Revolution. They thought that all people should be equal and share in power. Later, they would fight for these rights again.The French Revolution had ignited the spirit ofnationalismthroughout much of Europe by teaching that each government should be based on the will of the people. Nationalism is the belief that each nationality or ethnic group is entitled to its own government and national homeland. Napoleon’s conquests also inspired nationalist resentment against the French. Despite the stirrings of nationalism, the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna failed to take into account the desire of many people to control their own governments. Instead, they favored maintaining traditional rulers. As a result, many European peoples were still not united, while other continued to live under foreign rule.Comparing the American and French RevolutionsIn some ways the French Revolution was remarkably similar to the American. Both revolutions applied principles of the Enlightenment; both swept away traditional systems; both followed similar-stage courses, moving from moderate to radical before a final conservative swing; and both helped set in motion modern constitutional government, along with democracy and nationalism. There were, however, striking differences. Unlike the American colonies,Francehad a classic Old Regime, with aristocratic privilege and monarchy. Instead of being far removed from the centers of civilization, it was the most populous and cultured state of Western Europe. Its revolution, therefore, was more violent and more decisive.The French Revolution, as evidenced by the Napoleonic dictatorship which it produced, was an immediate failure; for France at the turn of the nineteenth century, had secured neither liberty, nor equality, nor fraternity. Except for certain prosperous members of the middle classes, the French economy promised less for most people in 1796 than it had two decades earlier. Most discouraging was the realization that the Revolution had betrayed its own ideals, leaving the French people cynical and disillusioned.The Revolution, nevertheless, had brought great changes. It had abolished serfdom and feudal privileges, created a uniform system of local government, laid the groundwork for a national education system, started legal reforms that would culminate in the great Napoleonic Code, abolished slavery in the colonies, and established the standardized metric system. The ideal, if not the practice, of constitutional government had been rooted in the French mind. Moreover, French armies, even before 1800, had scattered abroad the seeds of liberalism, constitutionalism, and even democracy. The most striking result of the Revolution in its own time was its violent disturbance of old orders; from Ireland to Poland, nothing would ever be the same again. The effects of the French Revolution would also soon be felt in the Americas.Video AssignmentWatch:History vs. Napoleonby TED EdWatch:The French RevolutionBy Crash CourseHow did the French Revolution change human history more than the American Revolution?What was the meeting of the Estates General? and why did Louis XVI call one?Describe the three Estates.What is a guillotine?Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentResearch the Declaration of Rights of Man, how was it similar and different to the Declaration of Independence?ReviewQuestionsHow did disputes over tax policy and social disparities lead to the French Revolution?What Enlightenment ideas are reflected in the Declaration of the Rights of Man?How do the causes, characteristics, and consequences of the American and French Revolutions compare?What are the principle ideas found in the major political documents formulated during the American and French Revolutions?

[WHS.9C]Locate places and regions of historical significance directly related to major eras and turning points in world history [WHS.16A]Describe how people have participated in supporting or changing their governments. [WHS.21A]The Independence of Latin AmericaOne of the most far-reaching effects of the American and French Revolutions was that they inspired independence movements in Latin America. A growing spirit of nationalism and the French ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity inspired many Latin Americans to rise up against their French, Spanish, and Portuguese masters. Though most all of Latin America would win independence from colonial rule, it would actually bring an increase in poverty, and the dream of a united Latin America would quickly fall apart.[Figure 2]Latin American SocietyThe termLatin Americaapplies to the lands south of the United States where Spanish, Portuguese, and French are spoken. All these languages developed from Latin. The region includes Mexico, Central America, South America, and islands of the Caribbean. On the surface, the Latin American revolutions of the early 1800’s appear similar to the American Revolution. In every case, revolutionaries over-threw a government controlled by a European country. The leaders of the revolution then set up a new national government.However, there were important differences between conditions in Latin America and in the United States. In Latin America, colonial society was sharply divided into classes based on birth. Struggles among these classes played an important part in the revolutions. At the top of Latin American society were thepeninsulares, people who had been born in Spain or Portugal. They held the most important positions in colonial government and in the Roman Catholic Church.Creolesranked next after the peninsulares. Creoles were people who were born in Latin America but whose ancestors came from Europe. This class included many wealthy landowners and lesser government officials. The peninsulares and the creoles formed an aristocracy in Latin American society. Together, they made up less than one-fifth of the population.Below the peninsulares and creoles ranked the common people who had few political rights and little share in the region’s wealth. The common people included mestizos, mulattoes, blacks, and Indians. Mestizos were people of mixed European and Indian ancestry. Mulattoes were of European and African ancestry. Some mestizos and mulattoes owned small farms or businesses. Most rented small farms from landlords. Most blacks worked as slaves on large plantations, although there were free blacks in many Latin American towns. The lowest ranking of all were the millions of Indians. They were legally free, but they were usually treated no better than slaves.A Revolution in HaitiThe first colony to free itself from European rule was the French colony of Saint Domingue, on the island of Hispaniola. Almost all of the people who lived in the colony were slaves of African origin. In 1791, about 100,000 of them rose in revolt.Toussaint L’Ouverture, an ex-slave, soon emerged as a leader. By 1801, he had moved to the eastern part of the island and freed the slaves there. In 1804, the former colony declared itself the independent country ofHaiti.South American IndependenceElsewhere in Latin America, creoles took the lead in the battle for independence. The Creoles had a number of long-standing grievances against Spain. Peninsulares held almost all the high government offices in Spain’s Latin American lands and kept tight control over the economy of its colonies. Merchants in Spanish colonies could trade only with Spain and sent their goods only on Spanish ships. The valuable mines of Mexico and Peru were under direct Spanish control, which the creoles resented.The direct cause of the Latin American revolts, however, was Napoleon’s conquest of Spain in 1808, after which Napoleon made his brother, Joseph, king of Spain. Many creoles might have remained loyal to a Spanish king, but they felt no loyalty at all too a Frenchman placed on the Spanish throne by force.Fighting broke out in 1810 in several parts of Latin America. The wars for independence were complicated and confusing. Loyalties were divided. The viceroys and their armies remained loyal to Spain, as did some creoles. Indians and mestizos fought on both sides, often forced into armies against their will.Two leaders pushed much of South America to independence.Simon Bolivarwas a writer, fighter, and political thinker. He survived defeats and exile to win independence for Venezuela in 1821.Jose de San Martinhelped win independence for Argentina in 1816 and Chile in 1818. Bolivar led their combined armies to a great victory in 1824 that gave independence to all the former Spanish colonies.Bolivar declared Venezuela’s independence from Spain in 1811, but the struggle seesawed back and forth, but the turning point came in 1819. Bolivar built up an army from many sources. He promised to end slavery, winning many black volunteers. Other volunteers came from Europe. In January 1819, Bolivar led his 2,500 soldiers on a daring march through the towering Andes into what is now Columbia. Coming from this unexpected direction, he took the Spanish army completely by surprise in Bogota and defeated them.Bolivar went on to free Venezuela in 1821. Next, he marched south into Ecuador. In the coastal city of Guayaquil, he met with the other great hero of the independence movement, San Martin. While Bolivar was freeing the northern part of South America, San Martin freed the south. After declaring Argentina’s independence in 1816, his army freed Chile in 1817 after a grueling march across the Andes. Next, San Martin took his army north by sea to Lima, Peru, in 1821. The Spanish army retreated into the mountains of Peru. To drive them out, San Martin needed a much a larger force. Otherwise, the Spaniards would remain a threat to all of independent South America. This was the problem that faced San Martin and Bolivar when they met at Guayaquil.No one knows how the two men reached an agreement. But San Martin left his army for Bolivar to command. Soon after, San Martin sailed for Europe. He died, almost forgotten, on French soil in 1850. Bolivar followed the Spaniards into the heights of the Andes. His forces defeated the Spanish army at the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824. This was the last major battle of the war for independence.In Brazil, independence took a different turn. When Napoleon’s armies entered Portugal in 1807, the royal family escaped to Brazil, its largest colony. For the next 14 years, it was the center of the Portuguese empire. By the time Napoleon was defeated, the people of Brazil wanted their independence. In 1822, 8,000 creoles signed a paper asking the son of Portugal’s king to rule an independent Brazil. He agreed, and Brazil became free that year through a bloodless revolt.Mexican IndependenceIn most Latin American countries, creoles led the revolutionary movements. In Mexico, ethnic and racial groups mixed more freely. There, Indians and mestizos played the leading role. Also, whereas in most Latin American countries the revolution began in the cities, in Mexico it began in the countryside.On September 16, 1810,FatherMiguel Hidalgo, a priest from the mountain village of Dolores, called on Indian peasants of his parish to rebel against their Spanish masters. Today, that call is known as thegrito de Dolores(the cry of Dolores).The began a 200 mile march toward Mexico City, armed with sickles, stones, and clubs, picking up thousands of new recruits and weapons along the way. Creole landlords fled for their lives. Soon Hidalgo had a force of 60,000 men behind him. He declared an end to slavery and called for other reforms.At Mexico City, however, the main Spanish army and the creoles joined forces against Hidalgo’s army. Hidalgo was betrayed by one of his officers, captured, and executed by a firing squad.The rebels found another strong leader in Jose Maria Morelos, who proved to be a far better general than Hidalgo had been. By 1813, Morelos’ army controlled all of Mexico except for the largest cities A Mexican congress, called by Morelos, declared Mexico an independent republic in 1813. Morelos wanted to set up a democratic government, tax the wealthy, and distribute lands to the peasants.Many creoles supported the idea of independence, but they were not willing to accept Morelos’ social reforms. A creole officer, Augustin de Iturbide, captured and executed Morelos in 1815. A few scattered groups of rebels fought on as guerrillas.Suddenly, events took a new turn. In 1820, a revolution in Spain put a new group in power. Mexico’s creoles feared that this Spanish government would take away their privileges. At once, the creoles united in support of independence. The very man who had killed Morelos, Iturbide, made peace with the last guerrilla leader. Then Iturbide proclaimed Mexico independent in 1821. Iturbide later made himself emperor, but he was soon ousted. When he tried to return to power in 1824, he was shot.Caudillos Dominate GovernmentsBy 1830, Latin America was home to 16 independent countries, but the citizens of these new countries had few political freedoms. All the countries were dominated by a small group of wealthy Creole aristocrats. Army leaders had come to power during the long struggle with Spain, and they continued to control Latin America after independence. By 1830, nearly all the countries of Latin America were run bycaudillos. Caudillos were political strongmen, usually army officers, who ruled as dictators. Many caudillos cared only for their own power and wealth. They did little to improve the lives of the common people. Changes of government most often took place at bayonet-point, as one caudillo was forced to give way to another.Throughout Latin America, independence actually brought an increase in poverty, as turmoil continued in the region. The wars had disrupted trade and devastated cities and countryside. After all the destruction, the dream of a united Latin America quickly fell apart. In South America, Bolivar’s united Gran Colombia divided into Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela in early 1830. And by 1841, the United Provinces of Central America had split into the republics of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras.The Monroe DoctrineIn one way, Lain America was luckier than other nonindustrial parts of the world. Despite the political confusion, Latin America was never again carved into colonies as Africa and Asia were in the late 1800s. Having won independence, Latin America succeeded in keeping it.Spain, however, had not given up hope of winning back its colonies. France too saw a chance to take over land in Latin America. Both Britain and the United States, however, were determined not to allow such a development.In 1823, U.S. President James Monroe announced “the American continents …. Are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.” This statement is known as theMonroe Doctrine. Alone, the United States was not strong enough to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. However, Great Britain also wanted to protect Latin American independence for economic reasons. During the wars for independence, many Latin American countries began trading with Britain rather than with Spain. British banks and businesses invested heavily in South America, especially in Argentina and Brazil.Britain’s only real economic rival in Latin America was the United States. However, most United States’ exports in the early 1800s came from the farm rather than the factory. Thus, there was little direct competition between the United States and Great Britain. Both countries were happy with the economic advantages they gained by Latin American independence.Video AssignmentLatin American Revolutionsby The Crash CourseWhat three institutions exercised control over the population?What was Simon Bolivar's role in the revolutions of Latin America?What is popular sovereignty?Haitian Revolutionsby The Crash CourseWhat were the most profitable crops of Saint-Domingue?What were the four large groups of Saint-Domingue?

Make a list of the machines in your household and on your person; you may arrive at a surprising number.Now imagine earlier generations during their childhood years. How did they move from place to place? How did they communicate? What foods did they eat?At one time, humans, fueled by the animals and plants they ate and the wood they burned, or aided by their domesticated animals, provided most of the energy in use. Windmills and waterwheels captured some extra energy, but there was little in reserve. All life operated within the fairly immediate flow of energy from the Sun to Earth.Everything changed during the Industrial Revolution, which began around 1750. People found an extra source of energy with an incredible capacity for work. That source was fossil fuels — coal, oil, and natural gas, though coal led the way — formed underground from the remains of plants and animals from much earlier geologic times. When these fuels were burned, they released energy, originally from the Sun, that had been stored for hundreds of millions of years.Coal was formed when huge trees from the Carboniferous period (345– 280 million years ago) fell and were covered with water so that oxygen and bacteria could not decay them. Instead, the pressure of the weight of materials above them compressed them into a dark, carbonic, ignitable rock.Most of the Earth’s oil and gas formed over a hundred million years ago from tiny animal skeletons and plant matter that fell to the bottom of seas or were buried in sediment. This organic matter was compacted by the weight of water and soil. Coal, oil, and gas, despite their relative abundance, are not evenly distributed on Earth; some places have much more than others, due to geographic factors and the diverse ecosystems that existed long ago.Early Steam EnginesThe story of the Industrial Revolution begins on the small island of Great Britain. By the early 18th century, people there had used up most of their trees for building houses and ships and for cooking and heating. In their search for something else to burn, they turned to the hunks of black stone (coal) that they found near the surface of the earth. Soon they were digging deeper to mine it. Their coal mines filled with water that needed to be removed; horses pulling up bucketfuls proved slow going.James Watt’s “Sun and Planet” steam engine © Bettmann/CORBISTo the rescue came James Watt (1736–1819), a Scottish instrument-maker who in 1776 designed an engine in which burning coal produced steam, which drove a piston assisted by a partial vacuum. (There had been earlier steam engines in Britain, and also in China and in Turkey, where one was used to turn the spit that roasts a lamb over a fire.) Its first application was to more quickly and efficiently pump water out of coal mines, to better allow for the extraction of the natural resource, but Watt’s engine worked well enough to be put to other uses; he became a wealthy man. After his patent ran out in 1800, others improved upon his engine. By 1900 engines burned 10 times more efficiently than they had a hundred years before.At the outset of the 19th century, British colonies in North America were producing lots of cotton, using machines to spin the cotton thread on spindles and to weave it into cloth on looms. When they attached a steam engine to these machines, they could easily outproduce India, up until then the world’s leading producer of cotton cloth. One steam engine could power many spindles and looms. This meant that people had to leave their homes and work together in factories.Early in the 19th century the British also invented steam locomotives and steamships, which revolutionized travel. In 1851 they held the first world’s fair, at which they exhibited telegraphs, sewing machines, revolvers, reaping machines, and steam hammers to demonstrate they that were the world’s leading manufacturer of machinery. By this time the characteristics of industrial society — smoke rising from factories, bigger cities and denser populations, railroads — could be seen in many places in Britain.Why Britain?Britain wasn’t the only place that had deposits of coal. So why didn’t the Industrial Revolution begin in China, or somewhere else that boasted this natural resource? Did it start in isolation in Britain, or were there global forces at work that shaped it? Was it geography or cultural institutions that mattered most? Historians have vigorously debated these questions, amassing as much evidence as possible for their answers.Possible reasons why industrialization began in Britain include:Shortage of wood and the abundance of convenient coal depositsCommercial-minded aristocracy; limited monarchySystem of free enterprise; limited government involvementGovernment support for commercial projects, for a strong navy to protect shipsCheap cotton produced by slaves in North AmericaHigh literacy ratesRule of law; protection of assetsValuable immigrants (Dutch, Jews, Huguenots [French Protestants])Possible reasons why industrialization did not begin in China include:Location of China’s coal, which was in the north, while economic activity was centered in the southThe rapid growth of population in China, giving less incentive for machines and more for labor-intensive methodsConfucian ideals that valued stability and frowned upon experimentation and changeLack of Chinese government support for maritime explorations, thinking its empire seemed large enough to provide everything neededChina’s focus on defending self from nomadic attacks from the north and westGlobal forces influencing the development of industrialization in Britain include:Britain’s location on the Atlantic OceanBritish colonies in North America, which provided land, labor, and marketsSilver from the Americas, used in trade with ChinaSocial and ideological conditions in Britain, and new thoughts about the economy, that encouraged an entrepreneurial spiritBy the way, if you’re wondering what oil and natural gas were doing while coal was powering the Industrial Revolution, they had been discovered long before and were in use, but mostly as fuels for lamps and other light sources. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that oil caught up — and surpassed — coal in use.Calcutta Harbor, c. 1860 © Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBISThe Spread of the Industrial RevolutionBritain tried to keep secret how its machines were made, but people went there to learn about them and took the techniques back home. Sometimes they smuggled the machines out in rowboats to neighboring countries. The first countries after Britain to develop factories and railroads were Belgium, Switzerland, France, and the states that became Germany. Building a national railroad system proved an essential part of industrialization. Belgium began its railroads in 1834, France in 1842, Switzerland in 1847, and Germany in the 1850s.Industrialization began in the United States when Samuel Slater emigrated from Britain to Rhode Island in 1789 and set up the first textile factory on U.S soil. He did this from memory, having left Britain without notes or plans that could have been confiscated by British authorities. Francis Cabot Cowell, of Massachusetts, visited Britain from 1810 to 1812 and returned to set up the first power loom and the first factory combining mechanical spinning and weaving in the States. Railroad construction in America boomed from the 1830s to 1870s. The American Civil War (1861–65) was the first truly industrial war — the increasingly urbanized and factory-based North fighting against the agriculture-focused South — and industrialization grew explosively afterward. By 1900 the United States had overtaken Britain in manufacturing, producing 24 percent of the world’s output.After 1870 both Russia and Japan were forced by losing wars to abolish their feudal systems and to compete in the industrializing world. In Japan, the monarchy proved flexible enough to survive through early industrialization. In Russia, a profoundly rural country, the Czar and the nobility undertook industrialization while trying to retain their dominance. Factory workers often worked 13-hour days without any legal rights. Discontent erupted repeatedly, and eventually, a revolution brought the Communist party to power in 1917.Industrialized nations used their strong armies and navies to colonize many parts of the world that were not industrialized, gaining access to the raw materials needed for their factories, a practice known as imperialism. In 1800 Europeans occupied or controlled about 34 percent of the land surface of the world; by 1914 this had risen to 84 percent.Britain led the 19th-century takeovers and ended the century with the largest noncontiguous empire the world has ever known. (“The sun never sets on the British Empire,” as the British liked to say.) Britain exerted great influence in China and the Ottoman Empire without taking over direct rule, while in India, Southeast Asia, and 60 percent of Africa, it assumed all governmental functions.In the last decade of the 19th century, most European nations grabbed for a piece of Africa, and by 1900 the only independent country left on the continent was Ethiopia. After World War II (1939–1945) Europe’s colonies demanded their independence, which didn’t always happen immediately or without conflict but eventually took root. Now, in the early 21st century, Brazil, China, and India are becoming economic powerhouses, while many European countries are enduring troubled economic times.Workers hauling coal near Fengjie, China, 2005 © Bob Sacha/CORBISConsequences of the Industrial RevolutionThe statistics that reflect the effects of industrialization are staggering. In 1700, before the widespread use of fossil fuels, the world had a population of 670 million people. By 2011 the world’s population had reached 6.7 billion, a 10-fold increase in a mere 300 years. In the 20th century alone, the world’s economy grew 14-fold, the per capita income grew almost fourfold, and the use of energy expanded at least 13-fold. This kind of growth has never before occurred in human history.Many people around the world today enjoy the benefits of industrialization. With so much more energy flowing through human systems than ever before, many of us must do much less hard physical labor than earlier generations did. People today are able to feed more babies and bring them to adulthood. Many people vote and participate in modern states, which provide education, social security, and health benefits. Large numbers of people enjoy levels of wealth, health, education, travel, and life expectancy unimagined before industrialization.The benefits of industrialization, however, have come at great cost. For one thing, the rate of change (acceleration) is now so rapid that individuals and social systems struggle to keep up. And strong arguments can be made about depersonalization in the age of mass production.The increased complexity of the industrial system has also brought increased fragility. Industrialization depends on the interaction of many diverse components, any one of which could fail. We know that many of the essential components of the industrial system, and the natural resources it depends on, are being compromised — the soil, the oceans, the atmosphere, the underground water levels, plants, and animals are all at risk. Will growth continue unchecked, or are we approaching the end of an unsustainable industrial era? Whatever the future holds, we’ll be debating — and dealing with — the consequences of modernization for years to come.Video AssignmentWatch:Coal, Steam, and the Industrial Revolutionby Crash CourseWhat was the Industrial Revolution?Why did the Industrial Revolution start in Europe and not elsewhere?What other countries were having their own Industrial Revolutions?Why did Europe have an economic advantage over them?Was the Industrial Revolution a good or a bad thing?Interactive Notebook AssignmentsResearch the termAnthropocene.What is the Anthropocene and when did it begin?What evidence is theretosupportthe theory that this is asignificantturning point in world history?Research the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution.Identify the top five inventions during this time period.How did these inventions impact industrial societies?Overall, did they have a positive or a negative impact?Why?Create a storyboard telling the story of someone living through the Industrial Revolution.Identify the gender, age, social class, and profession of your character.Research andinclude 10 facts about lifeduring theIndustrial Revolution for your character.Draw and color or print and paste 5 images about life during the Industrial Revolution.Conduct an O.P.T.I.C. analysis of the image below.O=Write a one-sentence overview of what you see in the image.P=Identify the significant parts of the image.T=What do the title and/or other information providedhelp explain?I=What interconnections can be made with all this information?C=Write a one paragraph conclusion putting the image into historical context andsummarizingthe contents in the image.Industrial Mill Town in Greater Manchester, England[Figure 6]Looking east into Radcliffe, 1902.ReviewQuestionsWhat were the causes of the transformation of work and life that we call the Industrial Revolution?What were the social, political, environmental, and economic implications of industrialization?How did the Industrial Revolution transform British society?In what ways did industrialization impact and change the family?What are the connections between 19th-century innovations and those of today?VocabularyMarie CurieA French-Polish physicist and chemist famous for her pioneering research on radioactivity.

[WH.18C]Economic SystemsSmith, Marx, and Keynes by Daniel AdlerEconomic Models for the Modern WorldSpanning three centuries of history, from the dawn of the industrial age to modern times, three diverse thinkers developed their own landmark theories on commerce, labor, and the global economy.The New York Stock Exchange, 2009 ©Justin Guariglia/CORBISEconomic Thought vs. Economic Behavior“Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life,” wrote 19th-century economist Alfred Marshall. What choices do you face in the ordinary business of your life? Buying clothing, deciding what to eat, or seeking a job — all involve considerations of cost, scarcity, and tradeoffs with other options. Whether or not you think of them as such, these are economic decisions.Now extend that idea to scales beyond your individual transactions. Modern society is woven together by a complex network of individual choices with local, national, and even global implications. Economics is the field of knowledge that seeks to systematically analyze, interpret, and understand these decisions. In practice, economics is a dynamic tool used by governments, businesses, and even individuals to observe, manage, and influence how people produce and consume goods and services.The three economists profiled in this article — Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes — contributed substantially to the development of economics as a science. Nevertheless, considerations of production, distribution, choice, scarcity, and alternate uses far predate these men, to the earliest days of humankind. Ages before there was economic thought, there was economic behavior.The Economics of the HuntIn the words of economic historian Roger Backhouse, “Economics does not have a beginning or a ‘founder’; people have always thought about questions that we now consider part of economics.” The earliest humans, for example, spent lots of energy to track and kill large game, which they would then need to distribute, and which each individual would decide to conserve or use. Even without developed cultural, commercial, or legal systems, effective economic decision-making was often imperative for survival.As hunter-gatherer groups coalesced into more organized societies, decisions about distributing resources and designating jobs became more complex. For many thousands of years, it was not the communal egalitarianism of hunter-gatherer times or by the individualism of today that drove such decisions. Rather, as 20th-century economic historian Robert Heilbroner says, people worked according to “custom” (doing work that was passed down from previous generations) or “command” (working to avoid violence or other retribution). Not the blacksmith in medieval Europe, the farmer in India, nor the pyramid-building slave in Egypt worked to advance his or her own goals, dreams, or prosperity.Early economies were also marked by an ambivalent attitude toward money and the pursuit of wealth for its own sake. Writes Heilbroner, “The idea of gain...was quite foreign to the great lower and middle strata of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and medieval cultures, only scattered throughout Renaissance and Reformation times, and largely absent in the majority of Eastern civilizations” (Heilbroner, pp. 24–25). Those who worked with money (merchants, lenders, and even craftsmen with specialized skills) were often viewed suspiciously and sometimes even punished for innovating within their trades. Consequently, skills and technology advanced gradually and similar jobs and standards extended across many generations.Around 1500 CE, several drastic changes were set in motion. Overseas trade established new networks and boosted collective learning and commercialization. Globally traded currency created an easily recognizable and transferrable store of wealth and medium for exchange. Individual markets, once physical places for the simple exchange of goods, began merging to create the market system, which, according to Heilbroner, “is not just a means of exchanging goods; it is a mechanism for sustaining and maintaining an entire society” (Heilbroner, pp. 26–27). By the 1600s and 1700s, custom and command ceased to exert as much influence as the pursuit of wealth. Rather than survival, obedience, or tradition, it was “the lure of gain...[that] steered the great majority to his or her task” (Heilbroner, p. 21). It was in this era, on the verge of the Industrial Revolution, that Adam Smith lived and worked.Adam SmithWhen the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) was born, industrialization and a profit-driven market system were replacing custom and command-driven economic systems across Europe. These changes reflected the intellectual shift toward rationality, progress, liberty, and secularism, generally referred to as the Enlightenment.An undated etching of Adam Smith, public domain.Smith studied in Glasgow, Scotland, and Oxford, England. As a professor and lecturer, private tutor to the children of European royalty, government economic adviser, and a customs commissioner for Scotland, Smith had a comprehensive understanding of economics, which was captured most powerfully inAn Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, better known (and referred to hereafter) asThe Wealth of Nations.Composed at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution,The Wealth of Nationsdescribes a world increasingly dominated by commerce and capitalism. Here, Smith gives his observations of a visit to a pin-making factory:One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations.... [An average factory of ten workers] could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore...might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day.(The Wealth of Nations, p. 10)In other words, the division of labor enabled one man to be as much as 4,800 times more productive than if he worked alone! In addition, Smith argued that people have a natural drive to improve their own lives. This self-interest, he suggested, propels markets to satisfy individual demands by producing the goods and services people want. He called this the “invisible hand,” and wrote, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest” (The Wealth of Nations, p. 20).He suggested that competition between businesses prevents exploitation of consumers by ensuring fair prices and quality products, encouraging constant economic innovation, and satisfying consumer demand. In short, competition keeps everyone honest, because customers treated unfairly by one business can always patronize another instead.Smith’s view that the complex functions of society and economy emerged, unintentionally yet effectively, from the self-interested actions of each individual must have been both reassuring and liberating to a world grasping for new means of economic, social, and political organization. It was certainly popular: the first edition ofThe Wealth of Nationssold out within six months.Smith’s remarkable insights not only captured his own time accurately; they also foresaw much of the economic future, which is evident in the endurance of free-market capitalism as the world’s foremost economic model for the last 200-plus years. Today, we call this arrangement “economic liberalism” (different from the “liberal” political alignment in America) and the liberalization of economies continues around the world (Balaam and Veseth, p. 48-49).Though Smith predicted many of the successes of industrial capitalism, he lived too early in the Industrial Revolution to see its worst excesses. It would take several more decades to produce a critic whose cynicism toward capitalism matched Smith’s optimism. That critic was Karl Marx.Karl MarxKarl Marx (1818–1883) was born in the midst of the Industrial Revolution, into a middle-class family in Prussia (a former German kingdom straddling parts of present-day Germany and Poland). He led a tumultuous life: he was jailed for public drunkenness as a college student; his home and personal appearance were unkempt; and he spent income frivolously, causing his family to frequently live on the brink of poverty. For most of his professional life, Marx was a writer for a variety of liberal, radical, and foreign newspapers, moving between Prussia, France, Belgium, and England because he was continually blacklisted or deported for his radical views.Karl Marx, January 1870 © adoc-photos/CORBISMarx’s attitude toward capitalism was scathing. In an age when “the Industrial Revolution had changed the process of production into a factory system and created a new ruling class of factory owners” (Bussing-Burks, p. 85), Marx perceived injustice, inequality, and the inevitability of change. Marx and his frequent coauthor, Friedrich Engels were outraged at the hardships faced by the working classes of industrial European cities, and they channeled this anger into two monumental written works that formed the basis of modern communism:The Communist Manifesto, published in 1848, and a four-volume, 2,500-page opus,Das Kapital,published in 1867.Marx’s analysis sees the “history of all...societies [as] the history of class struggle.” Marx interpreted human history as a series of eras, each defined by systems for producing goods, which created classes of rulers and the ruled. This process had already progressed from slavery to feudalism to capitalism and, in Marx’s view, would eventually lead to a classless society called communism.Why did Marx object to capitalism? He believed that “capitalists” (the owners of the machines, property, and infrastructure used to produce things) were a separate class from the workers, or “proletariat,” who own nothing but the right to sell their labor in exchange for wages. Marx theorized that capitalists, in competition with each other for profits, would squeeze as much work as possible out of the proletariat at the lowest possible price. Furthermore, competition would cause some capitalists’ firms to fail, increasing unemployment (and thus misery and poverty) among the proletariat. Innovations in technology were not necessarily positive; new machines would add to unemployment (by rendering human labor increasingly inefficient and obsolete) while also making work dull, repetitive, and alienating.Yet Marx was not altogether dismissive of capitalism, which he saw as a necessary stage for building a society’s standard of living. But in his view, the proletariat’s discontent would inevitably lead it to overthrow the ruling classes and create a more equitable society, at first socialist (wherein the state would control the economy and distribute resources more evenly) and then purely communist (a stateless, classless, egalitarian society without private property or nationality).Marx’s beliefs, theories, and predictions represent a school of thought called Marxism. International political economy professors David Balaam and Michael Veseth caution, however, that there is no definitive reading of Marx, and that “Marxism is at once a theory of economics, politics, sociology, and ethics. For some, it is also a call to action” (Balaam & Veseth, p. 73). As a call to action, Marxism was most influential in the 20th century, when it inspired various brands of revolutionary activity, including the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the rise of communist governments in China, Vietnam, and Cuba, as well as in many Eastern European and African nations. It has since fizzled out, with the U.S.S.R. collapsing in the early 1990s, China shifting toward a market-friendly economy, and smaller communist countries that depended on them adopting more market-oriented systems.As a theory, Marxism is arguably more durable. While some believe that communism’s decline disproves Marx, others draw upon his approach to critique economic phenomena on social grounds. Even as capitalism defines most of the world’s economies, Marxism remains alive in “the idea that capitalism can undergo serious scrutiny and adaptation” (Bussing-Burks, p. 95). In other words, Marx’s skepticism about capitalism initiated an ongoing conversation about its shortcomings and how it can be improved. While he was no Marxist, our third economist, John Maynard Keynes, was highly influential in confronting the dilemmas of capitalism in the early 20th century.John Maynard KeynesJohn Maynard Keynes (1883–1946, last name rhymes with “rains”) was born into an educated family, and during his life he worked in academia, economic publishing, private financial advising and management, currency speculation, and as an official in the British Treasury.A studio portrait of John Maynard Keynes by Gorden Anthony, late 1930s © Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBISWhile his contributions to economics were extensive, Keynes is most famous for his ideas about the Great Depression, the major economic crisis of the 20th century. The Depression’s effects were felt worldwide from roughly the early 1930s to the mid-1940s. The United States saw unemployment increase from 3 to 25 percent, a halving of the national income, and a near cessation of residential construction (Buchholz, p. 210).Keynes’s analysis of the Great Depression focused on the role of savings. In his 1936 bookThe General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes argued that excessive savings could lead to economic ruin. A weak economy made businesses hesitant or unable to make investments that created jobs. Without jobs, people had no income that, if spent, would have stimulated demand for more production. Savings increased in anticipation of economic hardship. But then savings dried up as joblessness persisted. Individual rationality (saving in hard times) led to collective irrationality (an unbreakable cycle of economic decline).Keynes believed the government should support the economy. While Keynes generally endorsed free-market capitalism, the Depression’s unique challenges required unique solutions. Keynes argued that only the government had the resources to spend the money that individual consumers and businesses could not, and so break the cycle.This approach proved relevant in the 1930s and ’40s. The New Deal government relief programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt were designed to stimulate the economy in the early 1930s, while cuts to the federal budget in the late ’30s caused an immediate economic downturn. Extensive government spending funding World War II coincided with the end of the Depression. While some Keynesian policies had mixed results, the overall picture seemed to confirm Keynes’s arguments, and until the 1970s, Keynesianism predominated American economics. The “Great Society” domestic social programs — including Medicare and education funding — reflected Keynesian thinking. So too did the establishment of many of the institutions that form the basis of international trade and finance, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. While the 1980s and ’90s saw a resurgence in “classical” economic theories closer to Smith than to Keynes, the recent “recession” presents a new opportunity to debate whether Keynesian economics are still viable.The Power of EconomicsLet’s return to our initial question: What choices do you face in the ordinary business of your life? Smith, Marx, and Keynes all explained how individual choices, conscious or otherwise, fit into a higher order, affecting not only those who make them but also their families, communities, countries, and even the world. Over time, many other thinkers have developed their own distinct models and agendas for explaining and managing economic activity.The power of economics lies in its ability to reveal the complex workings of society. The idea that we are all touched by economics is perhaps best summarized in a quote from Keynes himself:The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.(The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, p. 383)As society moves about the ordinary business of life, economics always hums along in the background; it is observed by some, influenced by others, yet it affects everybody.By Daniel AdlerVideo AssignmentWatch:Capitalism and Socialismby Crash Course World HistoryInteractive Notebook AssignmentsCreate a Venn diagram comparing the characteristics of capitalism and socialism.Conduct an O.P.T.I.C. analysis of the image below.O=Write a one sentence overview of what you see in the image.P=Identify the significant parts of the image.T=What do the title and/or other information provided help explain?I=What interconnections can be made with all this information?C=Write a one paragraph conclusion putting the image into historical context and summarizing the contents in the image.""Pyramid of Capitalism System""[Figure 6]International Workers of the World's ""Pyramid of Capitalist System"" cartoon is an example of socialist critiques of capitalism and of social stratification created during the Industrial Revolution.ReviewQuestionsWhat were Karl Marx's critiques of industrialization?What did Karl marx predict would happen as nations proceeded to industrialize?What were the origins of socialism and how did socialist ideas contrast with those of Adam Smith?How do the various economic systems ofcapitalism, socialism, and communism create economic imbalances between nations?Whywerecapitalist economies better at generating innovation than communist economies in the twentieth century?VocabularycapitalismAn economic system based on private ownership and on the investment of money in business ventures to make a profit.communismAn economic system in which, in theory, all means of production are owned by ""the people,"" private property does not exist, and all goods and services are shared equally.economic freedomThe freedom to produce, trade, and consume any goods and services acquired without the use of force, fraud or theft.free enterpriseAn economic system where the fewest possible restrictions are placed on business activities and ownership, and individuals are permitted to make their own economic decisions.laissez-faireThe idea that government should not interfere with or regulate industries and businesses.law of supply and demandThe economic theory that prices are determined by the interaction of supply and demand.Karl MarxAcknowledged as the ""father of communism,"" an opponent of capitalism who in his ""Communist Manifesto"" argued that the most important driver of history was that of class struggle.

This type of foreign policy was practiced by European nations and Japan throughout the 1800s and early 1900s. In every case, the stronger nation would experience industrialization prior to practicing imperialism on a foreign nation or region. This was due to the nearly insatiable demand for cheap raw materials and the need for markets to buy manufactured goods.Industrial RootsAbundant raw materials and vast markets are needed in order to maintain an industrialized economy. Raw materials such as iron and cotton can be turned into products such as steel and textiles. Finally, these products need to be sold to a market in order to realize a profit.The forces of industrialization caused nations to begin looking outside of their borders for cheaper and more abundant raw materials. Foreign populations were also viewed as vast markets where goods produced in domestic factories could be sold.Other CausesNationalism, or pride in one’s country, also contributed to the growth of imperialism. Citizens were proud of their country’s accomplishments, which sometimes included taking over foreign areas. As European nations became competitive with one another, there was an increased pressure to practice imperialism in order to maintain a balance of power in Europe.[Figure 2]“The White Man’s Burden (Apologies to Rudyard Kipling)” Judge, April 1, 1899As Europeans took over foreign lands, they viewed the culture of the native population to be inferior to their own. This concept became known as “The White Man’s Burden” after a popular poem by the same name was published by Rudyard Kipling in 1899. Some interpreted this poem to mean that it was the duty of imperializing nations to bring western culture and sensibility to the savage native populations that were encountered in far off lands. This is sometimes referred to as Social Darwinism or the belief that all human groups compete for survival, and that the stronger groups will replace the weaker groups. Others saw it as a warning to western nations to stop the harmful practice of imperialism.Causes of ImperialismEconomic MotivesThe Industrial Revolution created an insatiable demand for raw materials and new markets.NationalismEuropean nations wanted to demonstrate their power and prestige to the world.Balance of PowerEuropean nations were forced to acquire new colonies to achieve a balance with their neighbors and competitors.White Man's BurdenThe Europeans’ sense of superiority made them feel obligated to “civilize the heathen savages” they encountered.IndiaBritish East India Company[Figure 3]Fort William, the headquarters of the British East India Company in Kolkata, India.During the 1700s, a joint-stock company called the British East India Company was chartered by Queen Elizabeth I of England. The company’s main objective was to make a profit for shareholders by exploiting the abundant natural resources and gaining access to the markets in India.To do this, the British East India Company successfully used “divide and conquer” tactics to increase their control over entire regions of the Indian subcontinent. This strategy entailed fanning the flames of religious division between native Muslim and Hindu groups and taking advantage of the political rivalries that existed between local native rulers.By the 1830s, the British government had taken over control of the East India Company. Under British rule, native customs such as sati, the ritual suicide of a wife after her husband’s death, were banned. The British built schools and railroads, and missionaries spread Christianity.Sepoy MutinyBy 1857 the British army in India included a large number of Indian soldiers or Sepoys. The rifle cartridges that were distributed to the Sepoys had to be bitten to remove a cover before being inserted into a gun. Rumors circulated among the Sepoys that this cover had been greased with beef and pork fat. This angered Muslim Sepoys who were not supposed to consume pork, and the Hindu Sepoys who were not supposed to eat beef. Thus, the Sepoys revolted against the British army, which eventually ended the conflict through the use of force. This resulted in the British government officially taking control of India, making it a colony.[Figure 4]The Sepoy Mutany of 1857Some view this as the first act of Indian independence, which would not be achieved until after WWII with the formation of the countries of India and Pakistan.Rivalries in India: 1748-1760Both the French and the English East India Companies, to advance their commercial interests, offer military support in dynastic struggles within powerful Indian states. Helping a candidate to the throne opens a new region of influence, a new market.The death in 1748 of the Moghul viceroy in Hyderabad is followed by French and English assistance for rival sons of the dead ruler. Soon the two European nations are also fighting on opposite sides in a war of succession in the Carnatic (the coastal strip north and south of Madras).The French candidate succeeds in Hyderabad, and the English favorite prevails in the Carnatic. But the most striking event in either campaign is a dramatic intervention by Robert Clive in 1751. With 200 British and 300 Indian soldiers, he seizes Arcot (the capital of the Carnatic) and holds it through a seven-week siege.[Figure 5]Lord Robert CliveHis action and his subsequent defeat of a French and Indian force in battle wins the throne for his candidate. It also has the effect of diminishing the prestige in Indian eyes of the French army. Until now the French have had the better of the British in India (most notably in their capture of Madras in 1746).France and Britain remain rivals in southern India for the rest of the century. It is in the north that the balance changes significantly in Britain's favor, after a disaster of 1756. In that year the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-Ud-Daula, overwhelms the British settlement in Calcutta and locks some of his captives overnight in a room of the fort. The details of precisely what happened that night are obscure, but the event becomes known to the British as the Black Hole of Calcutta.To recover Calcutta, Clive sails north from Madras in October 1756. The fort is back in British hands by January 1757. But Clive now decides to intervene further in the politics of Bengal.He aims to place a more compliant nawab, Mir Jafar, on the throne of Bengal, and he achieves his purpose after defeating Siraj-Ud-Daula at Plassey in June 1757. For the next three years, Clive virtually rules the rich province of Bengal, using Mir Jafar as his political puppet. In doing so he establishes the pattern by which British control will gradually spread through India, in a patchwork of separate alliances with local rulers.In 1760 Clive returns to England, the possessor of vast and rapidly acquired wealth. Here too he sets a pattern, this time an unmistakably bad one. He is the first of the 'nabobs', whose fortunes derive from jobbery and bribes while administering Indian affairs.Seven Years' War: 1756-1763At the start of the Seven Years' War, the balance between the empires of France and Britain looks much as it has been since the late 17th century. By the end of it, in 1763, the situation is transformed. The change is less great in India. Even so, British rule in Bengal, established informally from 1757, represents an unprecedented level of European involvement in the subcontinent - and a level unmatched by France.[Figure 6]Collage of Seven Years WarIf the difference in India appears as yet slight, these years change out of all recognition the colonial situation in America. British victory over the French clinched in the capture of Quebec in 1759, is followed by dramatic French concessions in the Paris peace treaty of 1763.The war at sea: 1793-1796The renewal of war between Britain and France in 1793 is a continuation of a century-long conflict between the two most aggressive imperial powers. In recent engagements, the results have favored Britain, particularly in Canada and India during the Seven Years' War.In the new conflict, the first arena of war is another rich colonial region, the West Indies. During 1794 the British seize several of the smaller French islands in the Caribbean, at an extremely heavy cost in terms of troops dying of yellow fever. On 1 June 1794 (the Glorious First of June in British accounts) Richard Howe destroys a French squadron in the Atlantic - but fails in his primary purpose of harming the rich convoy being accompanied on its journey from America to France. “The greatest damage to French interests in the West Indies is done not by British fleets but by the ideals of the French Revolution.Middle EastNatural ResourcesBeginning in the 1800s, imperialism was also practiced in the Middle East. The prime attraction for most European nations was the presence of vast oil fields. The machinery produced as a result of the Industrial Revolution required oil to keep numerous moving parts lubricated. As the internal combustion engine became more popular around 1900, oil was also needed as a fuel.Strategic LocationStrategy also played a major role in the European conquest of the Middle East through imperialism. Two areas that Europe paid particular attention to were the Suez Canal and Palestine.Suez CanalThe French originally set out to build the Suez Canal in 1859. However, Britain soon became jealous because of the potential impact the shortcut between the Mediterranean and Red Seas could have on trade with its Indian colony. In 1875, the British wrested financial control of the Suez Canal away from the French and eventually made all of Egypt a protectorate in 1882.European Imperialism in ChinaOpium WarsIn the early 1800s,  the British treasury was being depleted due to its dependence upon imported tea from China. The Chinese still considered their nation to be the Middle Kingdom, and therefore viewed the goods the Europeans brought to trade with Western factories in Canton, China. as nearly worthless trinkets. To solve this trade imbalance Britain imported opium, processed from poppy plants grown in the Crown Colony of India, into China.Chinese officials attempted to ban the importation of the highly addictive opium but ultimately failed. The British declared war on China in a series of conflicts called the Opium Wars. Superior British military technology allowed them to claim victory and subject the Chinese to a series of unequal treaties.Unequal TreatiesAccording to the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing, the Chinese were to:Reimburse Britain for costs incurred fighting the ChineseOpen several ports to British tradeProvide Britain with complete control of Hong KongGrant extraterritoriality to British citizens living in ChinaSpheres of InfluenceEventually, several European nations followed suit, forcing China to sign a series of unequal treaties. Extraterritoriality guaranteed that European citizens in China were only subject to the laws of their own nation and could only be tried by their own courts. Eventually, western nations weary of governing foreign lands, established spheres of influence within China which guaranteed specific trading privileges to each nation within its respective sphere.[Figure 7]Spheres of influenceEventually, the United States demanded equal trading status within China, and rather than carve out its own sphere of influence, simply announced the Open Door Policy in 1899. This stated that all nations should have equal trading rights regardless of spheres of influence. While this may have prevented the further expansion of spheres of influences, it did little to restore Chinese sovereignty.Effects of European Imperialism in ChinaDisgusted with the failed efforts of the Manchu Dynasty in ridding China of opium or foreign influence after the Opium Wars, Chinese citizens staged the Taiping Rebellion between 1850-1864. Already weakened, the Chinese officials turned to foreigners for help in putting down the rebellion, killing millions of Chinese in the process.After the further insult of the Open Door Policy, Chinese nationalist staged the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Viewed as a threat to the profits they enjoyed in their imperialist spheres of influence, foreign nations formed an international coalition that ended the uprising. With this victory, additional concessions were granted to foreign nations within China.Finally, 5,000 years of dynastic rule in China came to an end in 1911. China tumbled into civil war as local warlords sought to control their locals, while nationalist leaders such as Sun Yixian sought to unify China. Civil war took hold of China after Sun’s death as Mao Zedong and his communist forces battled Sun's successor Jiang Jieshi for control of the country. In 1949, Mao established a communist government in mainland China while Jiang Jieshi fled to Taiwan and established a democratic government there.Japanese ImperialismPrior to the 1850’s Japan had limited contact with the west.  Only the Dutch were allowed to trade with Japan at the port of Nagasaki once a year.Commodore Matthew PerryIn 1853, the U.S. sent a fleet of ships under the command of Commodore Mathew Perry to Japan in order to end the nation’s self-imposed isolation and open it to trade. Soon, the Britain, Russia, and Holland negotiated similar treaties.  The intrusion of the West would become a turning point for feudal Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was criticized and ultimately overthrown for allowing western nations into Japan.Meiji RestorationIn 1868, Emperor Mutsushito was restored to the throne. He decided that in order to withstand the imperialistic might of the West, Japan would need to adopt western ways. This movement would be known as the Meiji Restoration.Japanese scholars were sent abroad to learn as much as possible about the West. Feudalism was abandoned in Japan in favor of a written constitution and the establishment of modern mechanized armed forces. Western technology was adopted which allowed the Japanese to fully industrialize in less than 50 years. By the end of the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese no longer feared that they would be imperialized. Rather, they set out to practice imperialism themselves.Japan's EmpireIn 1894-95 the Japanese engaged the Chinese in the Sino-Japanese War as they sought natural resources and trading rights on mainland Asia. These motives also brought them into conflict with Russia in the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War. Japan achieved victory in both conflicts, and Europeans in Japan during the Meiji Restoration surprised the world in doing so. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese marked the first time an Asian nation had defeated one from Europe.With the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth, Japan earned the following:Chinese port city trading rights;Control of Manchuria in China;Korea became its protectorate;Annexation of the island of SakhalinJapan was quickly emerging as a world-class power using western technology and methods while still maintaining its traditional cultural values.Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity SphereDuring the early 1900s, Japan practiced imperialism throughout Asia. A campaign to rid Asia of European imperialism was waged in which Japan occupied nations once held by the French, British, and the Dutch. Native leaders were installed as part of puppet governments that were manipulated by the Japanese.By 1940, Japan announced that it would form a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere which encouraged Asian nations to resist western imperialists in order to contribute to the industrial needs of the Japanese war machine. In fact, Japan was practicing its own form of imperialism by dominating its Asian neighbors.Post-War SuccessJapan's imperialistic ambitions soon brought the nation into conflict with the United States in WWII. After losing WWII, Japan was occupied by the United States during which time democratic reforms were instituted. The emperor was forced to renounce his divinity and the Japanese armed forces were disbanded. A parliamentary democracy was established and the United States provided economic aid to rebuild infrastructure.Soon, Japan demonstrated its economic prowess without taking advantage of its Asian neighbors through imperialism. By the 1980's Japan was being compared to the United States and West Germany as one of the great economic powers of the world.Slave Trade EndsAnti-Slave Trade LegislationIn the 1400s, the Portuguese established a number of trading outposts along the coastline of Africa. Later in the 1600s, the Dutch established the Cape Town settlement on the southwestern tip of Africa. Many of these early settlements were the starting point of the African Slave Trade that enslaved and forcibly sent many Africans overseas.By the 1800s, many European nations had passed laws banning the slave trade. Thanks in part to the Abolitionist movement.“God Almighty has set before me two Great Objects: the supression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners.”“You may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know.”― William WilberforceWilliam Wilberforce was an MP, a committed Christian and a vanguard in the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire. He campaigned all his life, despite opposition and ill health and championed reform in many areas of society. He was founder of the Church Mission Society.However, the illegal slave trade continued well throughout the 1800s.Scramble For AfricaIn the 1870s, the Belgian King Leopold sent emissaries to establish trade with native Africans in the Congo. This single act began a flurry of imperialistic activity as the other nations of Europe, including: France, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, Germany, Italy, and Portugal.Berlin ConferenceTo avoid conflict with one another in Africa, European leaders met in Berlin, Germany. With little regard or representation for native Africans, the European powers set about carving up Africa according to the following guidelines:Any sovereign power which wanted to claim any territory should inform the other powers “in order to ... make good any claim of their own.”Any such annexation should be validated by effective occupation.Treaties with African rulers were to be considered a valid title to sovereignty.By 1900, the only areas of Africa remaining independent were Liberia and Ethiopia.Zulu ResistanceIn the 1830s descendants of the original Dutch settlers, now called Boers, migrated into the interior of South Africa and began to engage in conflicts with the Zulu. These battles with the Boer settlers continued well into the late 1800s, but never truly threatened Zulu sovereignty.The Zulu were a south African tribe that placed an emphasis on military organization and skill, as established by their  legendary leader Shaka Zulu. Under Shaka’s rule, the Zulu broadened their land claims throughout southern Africa.Eventually, the Zulu came into the conflict with the British army as they expanded their control over southern Africa and invaded the homeland of the Zulu.Despite early victories, the Zulu were eventually defeated by the technology and vast resources at the command of the British troops. Soon, all of southern Africa would come under British control.Cecil Rhodes and the Boer WarCecil Rhodes was instrumental in assuring British dominance of southern Africa. He founded the De Beers Mining Company, eventually controlling 90% of the world’s diamond production. After becoming prime minister of the Cape Colony (now South Africa) in 1890, he used his influence to strengthen British control over the region.His master plan was to establish a Cape to Cairo railroad line that would link British colonial interests in Africa between Egypt and the Cape Colony in southern Africa. The Boers, however, provided heavy and eventually armed resistance to this proposal. After authorizing an aggressive invasion of the Boer Republic of Transvaal which ended poorly, Rhodes was removed from office. However, the seeds of the Boer War had been sown.Great Britain decided to annex the Boer republics, and with Boer resistance came the Boer War (1899-1902). By all accounts the fighting was vicious, with the Boers employing guerilla tactics and the British eventually using 450,000 troops to achieve victory.In 1910, the various British colonies in southern Africa were united as the Union of South Africa, eventually becoming the nation of South Africa after WWII.TribalismBecause European nation carved Africa up with no regard for traditional tribal boundaries, Africa still suffers from tribalism. Modern African nations often contain several different tribes that harbor ill feelings towards one another. Therefore, inter-tribal conflict is a common in Africa often leading to civil wars and power struggles within national governments.Impact of European ImperialismIn the short-term, imperialism was a very profitable foreign policy which came at the expense of the foreign regions where it was being practiced. Cultural diffusion also occurred, leading to an exchange of ideas between the West and the East. For example, European methods of education were adopted, leading foreigners to study ideas of liberty and democracy embraced during the Enlightenment and various political revolutions. This exchange eventually led to the demise of imperialism and colonialism throughout the world after World War Two.Video AssignmentWatch:Imperialismby Crash Course World HistoryInteractive Notebook AssignmentCreate a map detailing the area in which the British Empire controlled.List the Imperialistic European nations and the areas that they colonized.Explain the causes and motivations that led to European imperialization of Asia and Africa.Analyze map ""Spheres of Influence""; and then explain the significance of the location of each sphere of influence for each nation in the legend.ReviewQuestionsWhat motivated imperialist nations to expand into other regions of the world?What were the different characteristics of imperialism in different parts of the world?What was the legacy of imperialism upon those who fell under the control of the imperial powers?What technological innovations made possible the ""New Imperialism"" of the late 19th century?How did Queen Victoria influence British imperialism abroad and the role of the monarch?How did she serve as a role model for the upper classes of the Victorian Age?VocabularyimperialismThe policy of extending the rule or authority of an empire or nation over foreign countries.""new imperialism""The colonial expansion between 1830 and 1914 that contrasts with older forms of imperialism due to increased overseas possessions as well as the greater industrial capabilities now available to the imperial powers.social darwinismAn ideology that seeks to apply the biological concepts of Darwin's evolutionary theory to society and politics.informal imperialismA form of imperialism used to maintain indirect control of a colony, where local government officials are used to maintain imperial control, and a limited degree of self-rule is permitted.""white man's burden""A phrase taken from a poem by English poet Rudyard Kipling characterizing imperialism as a noble enterprise, by which white men were encouraged to colonize and rule over other nations for the benefit of those people.""Scramble for Africa""A process of invasion, occupation, colonization and annexation of African territory by European powers between 1881 and 1914.Berlin ConferenceMeetings begun in 1845 at which representatives from European nations agreed upon rules for the division and colonization of Africa.Cecil RhodesA key British imperialist who controlled 90% of the diamond industry and dreamed of building a British railroad from Cairo, Egypt to Cape Town, South Africa.Leopold IIA Belgian king who ruled the Congo as his private estate, killing millions in order to increase production on his rubber plantations.Suez CanalA man-made waterway completed in 1869, built with French money and Egyptian labor, that connected the Red and Mediterranean Seas.Opium WarsA conflict between Britain and China, lasting from 1839 to 1842 that resulted in foreigners having extraterritorial rights at various Chinese ports.""spheres of influence""Areas in which countries have some political and economic control but do not govern directly.Taiping RebellionA mid-19th century peasant rebellion in China against the Qing dynasty that lasted for 14 years and briefly managed to take control over much of southeastern China.""Open Door"" PolicyA policy proposed by the United States in 1899 in which all nations would have equal opportunity to trade in China.Boxer RebellionA rebellion in southeastern China in 1900 aimed at ending foreign influence in the country, eventually put down by a multi-national force of the imperial powers.Sepoy MutinyAn 1857 rebellion of Hindu and Muslim soldiers against the British in India after British officials responded badly to rumors that sepoy (Indian) soldiers were being asked to use gun cartridges sealed with beef and pork fat.Panama CanalA man made waterway in Panama built by the United States and opened in 1914 that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Spanish American WarA conflict in 1898 between the United States and Spain in which the United States supported Cuba's fight for independence.Monroe DoctrineA U.S. policy opposed to European interference or the establishment of colonies in Latin America.Meiji RestorationA series of events that restored the Emperor as ruler of Japan and led to Japan's industrialization and adoption of Western ways.Internet Resources

[WHS.16A]Explainthe effects of major new military technologies on World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. [WHS.28C]The Outbreak of World War IWorld War I introduced new technologies that generated a new kind of war – “total war.” It ushered in the notion of war on a grand and global scale, leaving behind a landscape of death and destruction such as was never before seen, and a death toll that included countless civilians. It devastated the economies of Europe and destroyed many acres of farmland, homes, villages, and towns. A sense of disillusionment, insecurity, and despair settled over the survivors. Its impact would help to ignite the Russian Revolution, one of the most significant events of the 20thcentury. Finally, the failure of the WWI peace settlement would contribute toward the outbreak of an even more destructive war two decades later.Prelude to WarIt had been 100 years since a major war had been fought on European soil (Napoleonic Wars).  Many Europeans believed that the industrial revolution had produced such a frightening arsenal of new and powerful weapons that the idea of a major war was now unthinkable. But serious tensions were building between theGreat Powersof Europe (Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Russia). In theBalkans, part of the new Austria-Hungarian Empire, rising nationalism among the persecutedSlavicminorities was a serious concern.  In 1914, a single incident would eventually bring most all of the European nations into a terrible, long war in which a roughly estimated 8 million soldiers and 6 million civilians would lose their lives. We call it World War I, or, The Great War.Let's review the situation among the major powers and problem areas of Europe in 1914:Great Britain- Politically stable, an industrial giant, has the largest navy in the world and is quite busy running a world empire. Britain is content and desires to stand alone, but has become alarmed at the rising power, both militarily and economically, of a relatively new nation, Germany. In particular, the British are concerned over Germany's growing industrial capabilities and its desire to build a navy large enough to challenge Britain's control of the seas (recall that Britain and Germany are separated only by the North Sea).Italy- Also a relatively new nation that, although powerful, is still politically unstable. Friendly toward Germany and Austria-Hungary.  The three nations have signed a defensive treaty known as theTriple Alliance, whereby each nation has promised not to fight one another should war ever break out.  Because Italy is practically surrounded by coastline, however, it certainly does not desire to wage a war against a major sea power such as Great Britain either.FranceandGermany- Otto Von Bismarck, the prime minister of Germany, had used war, trickery, and diplomacy to unite the various Germanic states into a new nation by 1870.  In 1870, France and Germany had fought theFranco-Prussian Warin which France suffered a humiliating defeat, was forced to pay Germany a huge sum of money and lostAlsace-Lorraine, an area rich in iron and coal deposits.  France seeks protection, revenge, and a return of Alsace-Lorraine from Germany, and begins looking for allies.  France remains politically disunited and still weak from the Franco-Prussian War, however. After securely uniting Germany (primarily through war), Bismarck then  embarked on a policy of peaceful diplomacy, believing that so long as France remained isolated and without allies, she would not pose a threat to Germany.  In 1890 -Kaiser William II, a ""vain, neurotic man,"" comes to power, removes Bismarck, and is envious of Great Britain’s world empire and navy.  He is determined to challenge Great Britain's industrial and naval power. Germany continues its rapid industrialization, seeks colonies (nearly going to war against France in Morocco), and begins a buildup of its navy.  Great Britain has become alarmed and begins to seek alliances rather than continue to stand alone.Russia- She has been slow to develop industrially and is a backward nation compared to Western Europe.  Russia, however, has the largest population and army in all of Europe. Russia has recently been humiliated in several wars or crisis (the Crimean War against France and Great Britain, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Balkan Crisis).  She remains weak and humiliated.  France desires Russia as an ally and is loaning it money to develop its industry.  Russia is also interested in forming alliances with theSlavicpeoples of theBalkans(most Russians were also Slavs) in order to gain access to the warmer waters and trade of the Mediterranean.  France and Russia promise to come to each other’s aid should either be attacked by a third country. Great Britain eventually agrees not to fight France or Russia should a war break out. These agreements between the nations of France, Great Britain and Russia formed theTriple Entente.Austria-Hungary(a dual monarchy with a single army and foreign policy) Austria-Hungary is interested in securing its southern region that is heavily populated by a restless, persecuted, and increasingly nationalistic Slavic minority (the Austrians were a Germanic people).  She is also interested in expanding south into the Balkans in order to maintain control over its Slavic population.The Balkans- This region had for many years been part of theOttoman Empire, which had become weak and was now unable to maintain its control over the area (the Ottoman Empire was called the“sick man of Europe""in these days).  The area was made up of many ethnic groups, though most of them spoke Slavic languages.  They had been persecuted terribly under Ottoman rule.  These ethnic groups were taking advantage of the weakness of the Ottomans and breaking away to form independent nations.  They are weak, however, and threatened by Austria-Hungary, which wishes to absorb them into their empire.Serbia, an independent, Slavic nation, desires to absorb all Slavs into an expanded Serbia. This desire of the Slavs to create a large, Slavic nation in the Balkans became known as Pan-Slavism.  Such a plan, of course, would require the breakup of Austria-Hungary, one of the Great Powers of Europe.  Russia desires to defend their Slavic cousins from Austrian-Hungarian rule and does not want to see Austria-Hungary control these nations, as this would spoil their plans to have access to the Mediterranean as well as to once again display her weakness to the rest of the world.  Russia does not feel it can afford to suffer another embarrassing defeat or humiliation. The Slavic population of the Balkans, meanwhile, looks to Russia for protection against the expansionist desires of Austria-Hungary.Because of the opposing interests of Russia and Austria-Hungary, and the demands of Serbian nationalists, it was here in the Balkans where most people feared a war could break out. The Balkans thus became known as the“powder keg of Europe.""Indeed, it would be in the Balkans where the ""war to end all wars"" would begin.Adding to these tensions was a growing spirit ofmilitarism(the glorification of armed strength). By 1914, many Europeans believed war was inevitable as all the Great Powers were building up large, standing armies. With the exception of Great Britain, who relied on her navy for defense, all the other European powers had adoptedconscription(compulsory military service). Generals made war plans and yearned for a chance to put their plans into practice.  Each country feared sitting around and waiting while their enemy became stronger.  Many urged their leaders not to wait.  Civilians, who had not experienced a major, general war in over 100 years, remembered only the glory of war and not the horrors of the Napoleonic wars.Thus, the primary underlying causes of WWI were:(1) The competing imperial interests of the Great Powers of Europe(2) Slavic nationalist aspirations and Austro-Hungarian imperialist ambitions in the Balkans(3) The division of Europe into threatening alliances(4) A growing spirit of militarismThese underlying causes needed only a spark to ignite the most destructive war the world had ever seen.  The spark would be ignited in the Balkans and quickly spread throughout Europe, engulfing practically the entire continent into war.[Figure 2]The Start of WarOn June 28, 1914, ArchdukeFranz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife, Sophie, were paying a state visit to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. The royal pair was shot at point blank range as they rode through the streets of Sarajevo in an open car. The killer wasGavrilo Princip, a 19-year-old member of the Black Hand, a secret society committed to ridding Bosnia of Austrian rule.Because the assassin was a Serbian, Austria decided to use the murders as an excuse to punish Serbia. An angry Kaiser Wilhelm II urged Austria to be aggressive and he offered Germany’s unconditional support. In effect, this gave Austria a“blank check,”or the license to do what it wanted in Serbia.On July 23, Austria presented Serbia with anultimatum(a list of demands that if not met, will lead to serious consequences). The ultimatum was deliberately harsh. Demands included an end to all anti-Austrian activity. In addition, Serbian leaders would have had to allow Austrian officials into their country to conduct an investigation into the assassinations. Serbia knew that refusing the ultimatum would lead to war against the more powerful Austria. Therefore, Serbian leaders agreed to most of Austria’s demands. They offered to have several others settle by an international conference. Austria, however, was in no mood to negotiate. The nation’s leaders, it seemed, had already settled on war. On July 28, Austria rejected Serbia’s offer and declared war.Leaders all over Europe suddenly took alarm. The fragile European stability seemed about to collapse. The British foreign minister, the Italian government, and even Kaiser Wilhelm himself urged Austria and Russia to negotiate. But it was too late. The machinery of war had been set in motion. On July 29, the first Austrian artillery shells fell on Serbia’s capital, Belgrade.After this first military action, a series of events followed in quick succession. With news of Austria’s attack on Belgrade, Russia ordered a general mobilization of its troops on July 30, 1914. Germany, interpreting this move as a final decision by Russia to go to war, promptly ordered its own mobilization. Although the Russian tsar and German Kaiser were communicating feverishly by telegraph throughout this time, they failed to convince each other that they were only taking precautionary measures. Britain made an attempt to intervene diplomatically, but to no avail. On August 1, the German ambassador to Russia handed the Russian foreign minister a declaration of war.On August 3, Germany, in accordance with theSchlieffen Plan, declared war on France as well. The Schlieffen Plan was a German military plan, formulated in 1905, that addressed how Germany should handle the threat of a war on two fronts with Russia and France. In short, the plan stipulated that if war were expected, Germany first attack France before embarking upon military actions against Russia. The rationale for this approach was that Russia would require several weeks in order to mobilize its troops and assemble them along the German border. Under the plan, Germany hoped to overrun France in only six weeks by attacking across France’s borders with Belgium and Holland, which were less fortified than the border with Germany.Germany now made clear its intention to cross the neutral nation of Belgium in order to reach France’s least fortified border, in violation of its own treaty in respect to neutral countries. Therefore, Britain, which had a defense agreement with Belgium, declared war on Germany the next day, August 4th.[Figure 3]By mid-August 1914, the battle lines were clearly drawn. On one side were Germany and Austria-Hungary, known as theCentral Powersbecause of their geographic location in the heart of Europe. On the other side were Great Britain, France, and Russia. They were known as theAllied Powers, or the Allies.Other powers soon joined the war. In October, Turkey joined the Central Powers. A year later, Bulgaria did the same. In the beginning, Italy stayed neutral. The Italians said that the Triple Alliance was a defensive alliance wand Germany had been the aggressor. However, nine months later Italy joined the Allies against Germany and Austria.In the late summer of 1914, millions of soldiers marched happily off to battle, convinced that the war would be short. Only a few people foresaw the horrors ahead. Staring out over London at nightfall, Britain’s foreign minister, Sir Edward Grey, said sadly to a friend, “The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.” Therefore, the German high command decided to send thousands of men to the east, which weakened the western army, whose supply lines were growing thin.At theBattle of the Marne River, the German advance was topped dead in its tracks and the German generals gave the order to retreat. Paris was saved. The German retreat left the Schlieffen plan in ruins. A quick victory in the west was no longer possible.  Germany had no hope of a quick victory in the east either. Although the Germans won several battles against the Russians in 1914, Russia was simply too big for overnight conquest. Germany’s generals now faced the fearful prospect of a long war on two fronts.Total War: A New Kind of WarfareAfter the Battle of the Marne, the war on the Western Front settled into a stalemate. Both sides dug in and held their existing positions. By early 1915, each army had built an elaborate system of tunnels, shelters, and trenches, from which they engaged intrench warfare. These battle lines stretched more than 600 miles from the English Channel to the Swiss border. The space between the two sets of trenches won the grim name of “no-man’s land.” As soldiers settled into the trenches for weeks and then months and then years, people began to realize that this war was unlike any other in history. Life in the trenches was pure misery. “The men slept in mud, washed in mud, ate mud, and dreamed in mud,” wrote one soldier. The trenches swarmed with rats, fresh food was nonexistent, and sleep was nearly impossible. When the officers ordered an attack, their men went “over the top” of their trenches into a bomb-out landscape. There, they usually met murderous rounds of machine-gun fire. Armies traded huge losses for pitifully small land gains.[Figure 5]The slaughter within the trenches reached a peak in 1916. At the Battle of Verdun, that lasted more than five months, each side would lose more than 300,000 men. At the Battle of the Somme, in the first day of battle alone, more than 20,000 British soldiers were killed. Several months later, each side had suffered over half a million casualties. What did each side gain from these two great battles? Near Verdun, the Germans advanced about four miles. In the Somme valley, the British advanced about five miles.During World War I, countries on both sides used the technology of the Industrial Revolution to help their armies. They invented new weapons and made older ones more deadly. One of these new weapons was the automaticmachine gun. It fired so rapidly that a soldier’s only protection was to take cover in the trenches. In 1915, Germany turned topoison gas, a mixture that choked and blinded it victims. The Allies quickly began using gas too. In 1916, thetankcame into use. While millions of soldiers struggled on the ground, a handful of fighting men launched a new kind of battle in the air. Here,airplanestook part in war for the first time in history. The age of the dogfight, or aerial battle, began. New weapons also changed the war at sea. Early in the war, Great Britain used its navy to blockade the North Sea coast in order to keep food and war materials from reaching Germany. The Germans fought back with a new invention, thesubmarineorU-boat. Germany would use its large fleet of U-boats to attack ships carrying food and war supplies to Britain.World War I soon became atotal war,meaning that countries devoted all their resources to the war effort. In each of the major countries fighting the war, the entire force of government was dedicated to winning the conflict by taking control of the economy. Governments told factories what to produce and how much. Numerous facilities were converted to munitions factories. Nearly every able-bodied civilian was put to work. So many goods were in short supply that governments turned torationing.In the past, most wars had been fought by professional soldiers. World War I was different. The long trench lines were manned by drafted civilians. In every country, the vast majority of men between 20 and 40 years of age were in military service for the duration of the war. Governments also suppressed anti-war activity, censored news about the war, and usedpropaganda(one-sided information designed to persuade) to keep up morale and support for the war. All the warring countries used books, posters, and news reports to arouse hatred of the enemy.[Figure 6]Total war also meant that governments turned to help from women as never before. Thousands of women replaced men in factories, offices, and shops. Women built tanks and munitions, plowed fields, paved streets, and ran hospitals. They also kept troops supplied with food, clothing, and weapons. Although most women left the work force within the year the war ended, the war changed many people’s views of what women were capable of doing.A Global ConflictAs trench warfare became the primary characteristic on the Western Front, fighting on other fronts played a crucial role in tipping the balance between the Allies and the Central Powers. In the east, Russians and Serbs battled Austrians, Turks, and Germans. The war in the east was more a war of movement than in the west, but here too stalemate was common. But in 1914, the Germans crushed the invading Russians at the Battle of Tannenberg. Afterward, the Germans gradually pressed the Russians a back into their own land.Russia never recovered from its defeat at Tannenberg. Short of food, guns, boots, and even blankets, the Russian army had only one asset – numbers. Russia’s enormous populations was used to refill the ranks of the army despite over-whelming casualties. For more than three years, that army tied up hundreds of thousands of German troops in the east. Thus, Germany could never hurl its full fighting force at the west.As the war dragged on, the Allies desperately searched for a way to end the stalemate. In February 1915, the British, Australian, New Zealand, and French troops made repeated assaults on the Dardanelles, the straits linking the Black and Mediterranean seas. The hoped to open the straits to send much needed supplies to Russia. Defending the straits were the Ottoman Turks, who had joined the Central Powers in October of 1914. The Allied assault, known as theGallipoli campaign, turned into another bloody stalemate. After almost a year of fighting, the Allies were forced to give up.[Figure 7]Collection of photos from the Gallipoli Campaign.Later, the British mounted more indirect campaigns against the Ottomans by organizing Arab nationalists in the Middle East. These campaigns were more successful than the direct attack on Turkey had been. Particularly devoted to the Arab cause was a British soldier named T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, who led daring guerrilla raids against the Turks. The Arabs were eager to revolt against their Turkish overlords. Gradually, Allied forces took control of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus.Far from the battlefields of Europe, places in Asia and Africa also saw fighting. Japan declared war against Germany within a few weeks after war had broken out in Europe. The Japanese quickly overran German possessions in China and captured most of Germany’s Pacific island colonies. In Africa, the British and French conquered most of Germany’s possessions. In German East Africa (modern Tanzania), however, Germany managed to hold out to the bitter end.The United States Enters the WarAlthough the Central Powers had won important military successes in 1916, those efforts had nearly exhausted their resources and manpower. Food shortages were already critical because of the British blockade. Worse, Germany’s potato crop failed in the summer of 1916.Desperate to strike a decisive blow, Germany decided to take a new risk. On January 31, 1917, the Germans announced that their submarines would sink without warning any ship in the waters around Britain. This policy was calledunrestricted submarine warfare.The Germans had tried this policy earlier in the war. On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat had sunk the British passenger shipLusitania, killing 1,198 people including 139 United States citizens. The attacks had outraged people in the United States. PresidentWoodrow Wilsonhad sent a strong protest to Germany. The Germans, fearing that the United States would declare war, backed down. They agreed to give warning to ships of a neutral country before firing.[Figure 8]The Cunard liner Lusitania speeding past the Fastnet lighthouse, probably outward bound for New York on her maiden voyageWhen the Germans returned to unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, they knew their decision would lead to war with the United States. However, they hoped to starve Britain into defeat before the United States could mobilize. Three days after Germany announced its plans, President Woodrow Wilson warned Germany that the United States would take any action necessary to protect its citizens. Soon after, German U-bots sank three American ships bound for Great Britain.In February 1917, another even added fuel to the fire. The British intercepted a telegram from Germany’s foreign secretary, Arthur Zimmermann, to the German minister in Mexico. The message said that Germany would help Mexico “reconquer” the land it had lost to the United States if Mexico would ally itself with Germany. The British quickly decoded the message and gave it to the United States government.[Figure 9]Historical Image of Zimmerman TelegramWhen theZimmermann notewas made public, many Americans called for war against Germany. Even before news of the note, many Americans had sided with the Allies. A large part of the American population felt a bond with England. The two nations had shared a common ancestry and language, as well as similar democratic institutions and legal systems. In addition, reports - some true and others not – of German war atrocities stirred anti-German sentiment in the United States. More importantly, America’s economic ties with the Allies were far stronger than those with the Central Powers. America traded with Great Britain and France more than twice as much as with Germany. The Zimmermann note simply proved to be the final straw. On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to declare war. The United States entered the war on the side of the Allies.This was much-needed news for the Allies, as just a month earlier Czar Nicholas II had renounced his throne. Russia’s suffering during the war had chipped away the people’s support for the Czar. The new government hoped to continue fighting the war, but the Russian armies refused. Just months later, a new revolution struck. Communists seized Russia’s government. They quickly signed theTreaty of Brest-Litovskwith Germany that gave up huge amounts of Russian territory in return for peace. In March 1918, Germany tried one final attack. Once again, the German army nearly reached Paris. The soldiers were tired, and supplies were short, thought. The Allies, now with fresh American troops, drove the Germans back.Upon this news, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire surrendered. In October, a revolution toppled the emperor of Austria-Hungary. In November, Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to step down in Germany. The new government agreed to stop fighting, and on November 11, 1918, the war was over.The Cost of the WarThe Cost of the War was staggering. Beyond the 8 million soldiers and 6 million civilians that lost their lives, World War I had shaken the economic and social foundations of Europe. A whole generation of young men had been struck down. France lost 20% of its men between the ages of 20 and 44, and Germany lost 15%. Almost every family in Europe had a son, a husband, or a brother who had been killed or maimed.The war also left deep scars in the memories of those who survived. Among them were writers, painters, and composers who passed on their experiences to others through their works. Their bitterness and pessimism ran through much of the art and literature of the 1920’s and 1930’s. Disillusioned and disheartened, these young people became known as theLost Generation. Britain’s under-secretary of the navy, Winston Churchill said that victory had been “bought so dear as to be indistinguishable from defeat.”A Flawed PeacePeace talks were scheduled to be held in Paris. The main leaders, the so calledBig Three, were Woodrow Wilson of the United States, Georges Clemenceau of France, and David Lloyd George of Britain. None of the defeated countries had been allowed to take part in the discussions. Their representatives were present now only to hear the verdict.Wilson pushed for his peace plan called theFourteen Points. He wanted to end secret treaties and alliances and give people the right to form their own nation, a policy known asself-determination. Self-determination meant allowing people to decide for themselves under what government they wished to live. In short, Wilson hoped to endimperialism. He also hoped to establish aLeague of Nations, a world organization that could police the actions of nations and prevent future wars. His Fourteen Points also argued for freedom of the seas, removing economic barriers to trade, and reducing the size of national armies and navies.Britain and especially France had different views. They had suffered greatly in the war and wanted to punish Germany. After long debates, the leaders finally agreed on a peace settlement called theTreaty of Versailles.The treaty established the League of Nations, as Wilson had hoped. It would include 32 nations, with the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and Italy making up the leadership. Germany and Russia were left out of the League. The treaty took away German land in Europe and its colonies. Limits were placed on the size of Germany’s armed forces. France regained Alsace-Lorraine and won the right to work the rich mines of the Saar basin for 15 years. After that time, the people of the Saar region were to have the right to rejoin Germany if they so wished.Poland once again became an independent nation. The new Poland received a large strip of German land called thePolish Corridor. This strip cut off East Prussia from the rest of Germany and gave Poland access to the Baltic Sea.The treaty had many clauses designed to keep Germans from ever again threatening the peace. The size of the German army was strictly limited. Germany could not manufacture war material. Submarines and airplanes were also banned. Furthermore, the Germans were forbidden to place any troops in theRhineland, a strip of land in western Germany between the Rhine River and the French border.Finally, Germany was given complete blame for the war in what came to be known as thewar guilt clause. Germany, therefore, would be required to payreparations(payments for war damage) to the Allies for the damage caused. The final reparations bill came to $31 billion, which Germany was to pay over the next 30 years.Other Treaties Created New NationsThe Versailles treaty with Germany was just one of five signed in Paris during 1919 and 1920. The other Central Powers also suffered losses in territory. However, out of the ashes of these old empires, Wilson’s idea of national self-determination guided the creation of several new nations.Turkey was forced to give up almost all of their old empire. Their territory was limited to what is now the country of Turkey. The lands that the Ottomans lost in Southwest Asia were formed into several new territories: Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Transjordan, and Syria. These areas becamemandates, (a territory that was administered on behalf of the League of Nations). The League of Nations assigned control of Palestine, Iraq, and Transjordan to Great Britain, Syria and Lebanon went to France. The treaty also recognized the independence of Saudi Arabia.Several new countries were carved out of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Austria and Hungary were both recognized as independent nations. However, they lost some territory to the newly formed countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Even before the peace treaty was signed, Germany had to cancel the severe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in which Germany had taken about a fourth of Russia’s European territory. Even so, Russia ended by losing more land than Germany. The Allies, fearful of Russia’s new revolutionary government, wanted to protect Russia’s neighbors to the west. As a result Russia lost land to both Romania and Poland. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which had all declared their independence from Russia I n 1918, were recognized as nations.The new country of Czechoslovakia included a region called theSudetenland. Some 3 million Germans lived in this border region. Furthermore, the treaties forbade any union between Germany and the now tiny state of Austria, whose 6 million people were nearly all German speaking.The United States Rejected the TreatyAcross the Atlantic, many Americans objected to the Treaty of Versailles, especially to the League of Nations. Some believed that the United States’ best hope for peace was to stay out of European affairs. Other Americans feared the League might undermine the powers of Congress in foreign affairs. They wanted to be sure, for example, that no American soldiers could be ordered to fight without Congress’s consent. After a bitter debate, the United States Senate refused to join the League of Nations or accept the Treaty of Versailles. The United States worked out a separate treaty with Germany and its allies several years later.In the end, the Treaty of Versailles did little to build a lasting peace. Instead, it left a legacy of bitterness and hatred. In the hearts of the German people. Other countries felt cheated and betrayed by the peace settlements. Lacking the support of several world powers, the League of Nations was in no position to take action on these complaints. It was, as one observer described it, “a peace built on quicksand.”Video AssignmentWho Started World War Iby Crash CourseArchdukes, Cynicism, and World War Iby Crash CourseHOW World War I Startedby Crash CourseHow does war begin as discussed in this particular video?2.

[WHS.16A]The Russian RevolutionTheRussian Revolution of 1917was one of the most significant events in the 20th century, and marked one of the most radical turning points in Russia’s 1,300-year history. The Russian Revolution removed Russia from WWI and brought about the transformation of Russia into theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). It replaced Russia’s traditional monarchy with the world’s first Communist state. The new communist government, led byVladimir Lenin, would solidify its power only after three years of civil war. The revolution affected economics, social structure, culture, international relations, industrial development, and most any other benchmark by which one might measure a revolution. Although the new government would prove to be at least as repressive as the one it replaced, the country’s new rulers were drawn largely from the intellectual and working classes rather than from the aristocracy—which meant a considerable change in direction for Russia. Over the next several decades, the Soviet Union would actively sponsor and assist Communist movements and revolutions around the world in an effort to broaden its sphere of influence.CausesThe Russian Revolution was the culmination of a long period of repression and unrest. From the time of Peter the Great, the czarist government had increasingly became an autocratic bureaucracy that imposed its will on the people by force, with wanton disregard for human life and liberty.In 1881, student revolutionaries who were angry over the slow pace of political change assassinated Alexander II, a reform-minded czar. When his son, Alexander III took the throne, he halted all reforms in Russia, clinging to the principles of “autocracy, orthodoxy, and nationality.” To wipe out revolutionaries, Alexander III used harsh measures. He imposed strict censorship on published materials and written documents, including private letters. His secret police carefully watched both secondary schools and universities. Political prisoners were exiled to Siberia.To establish a uniform Russian culture, Alexander III oppressed other national groups within Russia. He made Russian the official language of the empire and forbade the use of minority languages, such as Polish, in schools. Alexander made Jews the special target of persecution, leading to a wave ofpogroms– organized violence against Jews – where police and soldiers stood by and watched Russian citizens loot and destroy Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues.WhenNicolas IIbecame czar in 1894, he was determined to maintain the principle of autocracy. Russia, however, was slowly industrializing, which only further spread discontent. Grueling working conditions, miserably low wages and child labor were common, while trade unions were outlawed. As the gap between the rich and poor grew, exploited laborers who worked in factories and built the railway lines organized strikes.Amid the widespread unrest of workers and other members of Russian society, various revolutionary movements began to grow and compete for power. The group that would eventually succeed in establishing a new government in Russia followed the views ofKarl Marx. These revolutionaries believed that the industrial class of workers would overthrow the czar. The industrial class would then form “a dictatorship of the proletariat.” In such a state, the workers would rule. One such Marxist group the,Bolsheviks, supported the idea that change could best be brought about by a small number of committed revolutionaries willing to sacrifice everything for radical change. The major leader of the Bolsheviks was Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, who adopted the name ofLenin. He had an engaging personality, was an excellent organizer, and was ruthless. In the early 1900’s, Lenin fled to Western Europe to avoid arrest by the czarist regime. He maintained contact with other Bolsheviks until he believed he could safely return to Russia.[Figure 2]Crisis at Home and AbroadThe revolutionaries would not have to wait long to realize their visions. Between 1904 and 1917, Russia faced a series of crisis. These events showed the czar’s weakness and paved the way for revolution.Bloody Sunday: The Revolution of 1905The year 1905 revealed all too clearly CzarNicholas II’s perceived indifference, brutality, and weakness. On Sunday, January 9, a crowd of over 100,000 marched peacefully through the center of St. Petersburg, eventually assembling in front of the Czar’s Winter Palace. Unaware that the tsar was not in town that day, they called for the tsar to appear so that they could present him with a petition.The police, who had just finished putting down a series of strikes by industrial workers, followed their standing orders to get rid of any problems. Their solution was to open fire on the crowd, which included women and children as well as church leaders. As the crowd scattered, police pursued them on horseback, continuing to fire on them. Many in the crowd were trampled to death in the ensuing panic. Estimates of the total death toll range from a few hundred to several thousand.News of the massacre spread quickly, and many saw it as a sign that the tsar no longer cared about his people. The incident earned Nicholas the title “Nicholas the Bloody” even though he did not in fact know about the violence until it was already over. An unorganized series of demonstrations, riots, strikes, and assorted episodes of violence erupted across Russia in the following months.The Russian Constitution and DumaAny chance for Nicholas II to regain his standing was soon lost, as Russia was rocked by a long series of disasters, scandals, and political failures. During the first half of 1905, Russia suffered a humiliating military defeat against Japan in theRusso-Japanese War. Later in the year, the tsar reluctantly gave in to heavy political pressure and granted Russia its first constitution. Permission to form Russia’s first parliament, called theDuma, was also soon granted.[Figure 3]Russian State DumaThe leaders of the first Duma that met in May 1906 were moderates who wanted Russia to become a constitutional monarchy similar to Britain. Hesitant to share his power, the czar dissolved the Duma after ten weeks. Other Dumas would meet later. Yet none would have real power to make sweeping reforms.In the meantime, Nicholas’s own family became the subject of a different sort of crisis. His wife, Alexandra, had begun consulting with a mystic peasant namedGrigory Rasputinin a desperate attempt to help her hemophiliac son, Alexis. It seemed to her that Rasputin had the ability to ease the boy’s symptoms. In time, the self-proclaimed monk Rasputin gained political influence over the tsar through his wife, while at the same time engaging in scandalous sexual escapades throughout the Russian capital. Rumors quickly spread that Rasputin had magical powers and that he had the entire royal family under some sort of spell.World War IIt was in the midst of this scandal that Nicholas drew Russia into World War I in the summer of 1914. In 1915, Nicholas moved his headquarters to the war front. From there, he hoped to rally his discouraged troops to victory. His wife, Czarina Alexandra, ran the government while he was away, ignoring the czar’s chief advisers and, instead continuing to fall under the influence of Rasputin. The war was a disaster for Russia: it caused inflation, plunged the country into a food shortage, and ultimately cost the lives of nearly 5 million Russian soldiers and civilians, as well as a series of humiliating military defeats. As in the Russo-Japanese War, Russia’s involvement in World War I revealed the weaknesses of czarist rule and military leadership.The war was the final straw for the Russian people. In 1916, a group of nobles murdered Rasputin, fearing his increasing role in government affairs. But it was too late, as popular discontentment was at an all-time high. Soldiers mutinied, deserted, or ignored orders. On the home-front, food and fuel supplies were dwindling. Prices were wildly inflated. People from all classes were clamoring for change and an end to the war. Neither Nicholas nor Alexandra proved capable of tackling these enormous problems.The March RevolutionWith Russia faring poorly in World War I and facing severe food shortages, strikes and public protests happened in the country with increasing frequency during 1916 and early 1917. Violent encounters between protesters and authorities also increased.On February 23, 1917, a large gathering of working-class women convened in the center of Petrograd to mark International Women’s Day. The gathering took the form of a protest demonstration calling for “bread and peace.” While the demonstration began peacefully, the next morning it turned violent as the women were joined by hundreds of thousands of male workers who went on strike and flooded the streets, openly calling for an end to the war and even to the monarchy. Feeding on their outrage with each passing day, the demonstrations became larger and rowdier, and the outnumbered police were unable to control the crowds.With news of the unrest, Tsar Nicholas II, who was away visiting his troops on the front, sent a telegram to Petrograd’s military commander on February 25, ordering him to bring an end to the riots by the next day. In their efforts to carry out the tsar’s order, several troops of a local guard regiment fired upon the crowds on February 26. The regiment fell into chaos, as many soldiers felt more empathy for the crowds than for the tsar. The next day, more than 80,000 troops mutinied and joined with the crowds, in many cases directly fighting the police.The events in March of 1917 forced Czar Nicholas II to abdicate his throne. The Czarist rule of the Romanov dynasty, which spanned over three centuries, had finally collapsed. The March Revolution succeeded in bringing down the czar, yet it failed to set up a strong government to replace his regime.Leaders of the Duma established a provisional government under the leadership of Alexander Kerensky. His decision to continue fighting the war cost him the support of both soldiers and civilians. As the war dragged on, conditions inside Russia worsened. Angry peasants demanded land. City workers grew more radical. Social revolutionaries, competing for power formedsoviets. Soviets were local councils consisting of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In many cities especially Petrograd, the soviets had more influence that the provisional government.[Figure 4]The Bolshevik RevolutionThe Germans launched their own “secret weapon” that would erode the provisional government’s authority. They arranged Lenin’s return to Russia after many years of exile. The Germans believed that Lenin and his Bolshevik supporters would stir unrest in Russia and hurt the Russian war effort. Traveling in a sealed railway boxcar, Lenin reached Petrograd in April 1917.Lenin and the Bolsheviks recognized their opportunity to seize power. They soon gained control of the Petrograd soviet, as well as the soviets in other major Russian cities. By the fall of 1917, people in the cities were rallying to the call, “All power to the Soviets.” Lenin’s slogan of“Peace, Land, and Bread,”was gaining widespread appeal. Lenin decided to take action.In November 1917, without warning, Bolshevik Red Guards made up of armed factory workers stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd. They took over government offices and arrested the leaders of the provisional government. The Bolshevik Revolution was over in a matter of hours. Not a single shot was fired, as those appointed to guard these sites either fled or were disarmed without incident. Even the headquarters of the General Staff—the army headquarters—was taken without resistance.After Lenin’s government secured power, one of its first major goals was to get Russia out of the World War. In November 1917, the new government ordered Russian troops to cease all hostilities on the front. In March of 1918, Russian and Germany signed theTreaty of Brest-Litovsk.Russia’s exit from the war was very costly, but Lenin was desperate to end the war at any cost, as the Germans were threatening to  . In the peace, Lenin consented to give up most of Russia’s territorial gains since the time of Peter the Great. The lost territories included Finland,Poland,Latvia,Lithuania,Estonia,Ukraine,Belarus,Bessarabia, and the Caucasus region, along with some of the coal-mining lands of  . The Soviets would not regain these territories until the end of World War II.Civil War Rages in RussiaStill recovering from their painful losses of land to Germany, the Bolsheviks now face a new challenge – stamping out their enemies at home. Their opponents formed the White Army. The revolutionary leader, Leon Trotsky, who helped negotiate the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk expertly commanded the Bolshevik Red Army. From 1918 to 1920, civil war raged in Russia. Several Western nations, including the United States, sent military aid and forces to Russia to help the White Army.Russia’s civil war proved far more deadly than the earlier revolutions, and even deadlier than its involvement in World War I. Around 15 million Russians died in the three-year struggle and in the famine that followed. The destruction and loss of life from fighting, hunger, and a worldwide flu epidemic left Russia in chaos.In the end the Red Army triumphed and finally crushed all opposition to Bolshevik rule. The victory showed that the Bolsheviks were able both to seize power and to maintain it. Yet in the aftermath of the civil war, Lenin and the Bolsheviks faced over-whelming problems.[Figure 5]Lenin’s New Economic PolicyWar and revolution destroyed the Russian economy. Trade was at a standstill. Industrial production dropped and many skilled workers fled to other countries. Lenin, who helped mastermind the Bolshevik Revolution, shifted his role. He turned to reviving the economy and restructuring the government.In March 1921, Lenin launched theNew Economic Policy (NEP)by temporarily putting aside his plan for a state-controlled economy. Instead, he resorted to a small-scale version of capitalism. The reforms under the NEP allowed peasants to sell their surplus crops instead of turning them over to the government. Individuals could buy and sell goods for profit. The government kept control of major industries, banks, and means of communication, but it let some small factories, businesses, and farms operate under private ownership. Lenin also tried to encourage foreign investment.Political ReformsThe many different nationalities within Russia had always posed an obstacle to national unity. Communist leaders also saw nationalism as a threat to unity and party loyalty. To keep nationalism in check, Lenin organized Russia into several self-governing republics under the central government. In 1922, the country was named theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), in honor of the councils that helped launch the Bolshevik Revolution. Each republic was controlled from the new capital, Moscow.[Figure 6]The Bolsheviks also renamed their party the Communist Party. The name came from the writings of Karl Marx. He had used the word communism to describe the classless society that would exist after the workers had seized power. In 1924, the Communists created a constitution based on socialist and democratic principles. In reality, the Communist Party held all the power. Lenin had established a dictatorship of the Communist Party, not “a dictatorship of the proletariat,” as Marx had promoted.Thanks partly to the new policies and to the peace that followed the civil war, the USSR slowly recovered. By 1928, the country’s farms and factories were producing as much as they had before World War I. Lenin did not live to see this recovery. He had several strokes and spent the last 18 months of his life as a semi-invalid. His death in 1924 would open a power struggle for control of the party and the country. Eventually, Lenin’s successor, Joseph Stalin, would build a totalitarian state in the USSR, dramatically transforming the government and controlling every aspect of citizen’s life.Video AssignmentWatch:History vs. Vladimir Leninby TED EdInteractive Student Notebook AssignmentsHere is a puzzle: why was the ""February Revolution"" in March and the ""October Revolution"" in November?

[WHS.21A]Describethe rights and responsibilities of citizens and non-citizens in civic participation throughout history. [WHS.21B]Mexican RevolutionTheMexican Revolutionhas been called “the defining event” in the history of modern Mexico. The tumultuous, epic struggle was born out of three-and-a-half decades of autocratic rule by military strong man Porfirio Diaz. His ouster in 1911 unleashed a violent competition for political and economic reform that would eventually pave the way for a new national constitution that would bring much needed reform and stability to Mexico. By the end of the conflict, The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) had established itself as the primary political party in Mexico that would rule for 71 years.[Figure 2]Antonio Lopez de Santa Annawas a leading figure in the early history of independent Mexico. He fought to win independence from Spain and led in another war when Spain tried to recapture Mexico. He served as president four times, shrewdly changing his positions in order to retain power.In the 1830’s, though, he was unable to prevent people in Texas from winning their freedom independence from Mexico. In the 1840’s, the United States annexed Texas, which angered many Mexicans. When a border dispute broke out, the United States invaded Mexico. Santa Anna led his nation’s army and was defeated. Mexico had to surrender huge amounts of land.[Figure 3]Another important leader of the middle 1800’s wasBenito Juarez. A Zapotec Indian, Juarez wanted to improve conditions for the poor in Mexico. He led a movement calledLa Reforma– the reform – that aimed at breaking the power of the large landowners and giving more schooling to the poor. He and his liberal supporters won control of the government in 1858. The conservatives who opposed them did not give up, however. They plotted with France to retake Mexico. In 1862, Napoleon III of France sent an army that captured the country in 18 months. He named a European noble as emperor. But, Juarez and his followers kept fighting. Five years later, they drove the French from Mexican soil and killed the emperor.Juarez once again pressed for his reforms. He made some progress but died in office in 1872. Soon after, a new leader emerged.Porfirio Diazdominated Mexican politics for more than 30 years. Diaz brought order to the country. He ended raids by bandit gangs and he brought some economic growth. However, he sharply limited political freedom. Elections became meaningless. Diaz offered land, power, or political favors to anyone who supported him. He terrorized many who didn’t support him, ordering them to be beaten or put in jail.By the early 1900’s, Mexicans from many walks of life began to protest Diaz’s harsh rule. Idealistic liberals hungered for liberty. Farm laborers hungered for land. Workers hungered for fairer wages and better working conditions. Even some of Diaz’s hand-picked political allies spoke out for reform. A variety of political parties began to form. Among the most powerful was a party led byFrancisco Madero.[Figure 4]Madero Begins the RevolutionBorn into one of Mexico’s ten richest families, Francisco Madero was educated in the United States and France. He believed in democracy and wanted to strengthen its hold in Mexico. Madero announced his candidacy for president of Mexico early in 1910. Soon afterward, Diaz had him arrested. From exile I n t he United States, Madero called for an armed revolution against Diaz.The Mexican Revolution began slowly. Leaders arose in different parts of Mexico and gathered their own armies. In the north, cowboy Francisco “Pancho” Villa became immensely popular. He had a bold Robin-Hood policy of taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor. South of Mexico City, another strong, popular leader, Emiliano Zapata, raised a powerful revolutionary army. Like Villa, Zapata came from a poor family. He was determined to see that land was returned to peasants and small farmers. He wanted the laws reformed to protect their rights. “Tierra y Libertad– Land and Liberty – was his battle cry. Villa, Zapata, and other armed revolutionaries won important victories against Diaz’s army. By the spring of 1911, Diaz agreed to step down and called for new elections.Madero was elected president in November 1911. But he had a difficult time holding on to power. He resigned and was murdered shortly afterward. The military leader General Victoriano Huerta then took over the presidency. Huerta was unpopular with many people, including Villa and Zapata. These revolutionary leaders allied themselves with another politician who also wanted to overthrow Huerta. His name was Venustiano Carranza. Their three armies advanced seizing the Mexican countryside from Huerta’s forces and approaching Mexico City.  They overthrew Huerta only 15 months after he took power.Carranza took over the government. He then turned his army on his former revolutionary allies. Both Villa and Zapata continued to fight. In 1919, however, Carranza lured Zapata into a trap and murdered him. With Zapata’s death, the civil war also came to an end. More than a million Mexicans had lost their lives.The New Mexican ConstitutionCarranza began a revision of Mexico’s constitution. It was adopted in 1917. A revolutionary document, that constitution is still in effect today. It promoted education and rights for workers and women. The constitution also called for breaking up large landholdings and limiting foreign ownership of business. Carranza didn’t support he final version of the constitution, however, and in 1920, he was overthrown by his former general, Alvaro Obregon.[Figure 5]First page of Mexican ConstitutionAlthough Obregon seized power violently, he did not remain a dictator. Instead, he supported the reforms the constitution called for. He also promoted public education. Mexican public schools taught a common language, Spanish, and stressed nationalism. In this way, his policies helped unite the various regions and peoples of the country. Nevertheless, Obregon was assassinated in 1928.The next year, a new political party that attempted to address the interests of all sectors of the society arose. Although the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) did not tolerate opposition, it initiated an ongoing period of peace and political stability in Mexico.Video AssignmentThe Mexican Revolution #LAST100 wk 8by UBC Latin American StudiesWhat is an ""old guard""?Who are the two iconic men whose lives were taken during the revolution?What did EZLN stand for?Interactive Student Notebook AssignmentsFrom the perspective of a peasant, wealthy landowner, or a laborer.

The crisis devastated the economies of many nations and led to a period of financial hardship for millions of people.In the history of the United States, no other depression had had such a devastating impact on U.S. society. During the 12 years of the depression, one-quarter of the work force was unemployed, 5,500 banks closed, and 32,000 businesses went bankrupt.Although the crash of the New York Stock Exchange on October 29, 1929 was a symptom rather than a cause of the depression, it has been blamed as the catalyst. The depression in fact resulted from an overextension of credit and spending in the 1920s. Nonetheless, thestock market crashdramatically shook public confidence in the U.S. economy.[Figure 2]Cleaner sweeping the floor after the Wall Street crash, 1929The crash also brought an end to the loans that the United States had extended to European countries, which were still recovering from World War I. Europe slipped further into decline and lost any economic gains made in the 10 years since the end of the war.The economies of many Latin American and Asian countries, organized around the export of primary products to the industrial markets of the North Atlantic world, quickly collapsed in response to the loss of their markets. The global crisis was exacerbated by the tendency of most nations to erect tariff barriers in an attempt to protect domestic economies. As international trade ground to a halt, there was no way to alleviate the situation.The Great Depression produced political crises in many of the nations that were hardest hit. In Latin America, for example, several governments fell between 1929 and 1931; democracies were replaced by authoritarian regimes, and dictatorships were overthrown by democratic forces. In Europe, the hardships of the depression inspired a variety of extremist political groups. The desperate economic situation of the German Weimar Republic was an important condition for the rise of fascism in the later 1930s.In the United States, threats to the stability of the U.S. government and economy were dispelled by the ""New Deal"" programs devised by the administration of PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt.[Figure 3]Signing Of The Social Security ActTotalitarianism Develops out of Economic CrisisFascismis a political ideology that originated in South and Central Europe and that was the basis of a mass political movement from 1919 through 1945. The term ""fascism"" was first used in 1919 byBenito Mussoliniin Italy to describe his new political party. Similar movements then developed across Europe, establishing lasting regimes in Italy (1922), Germany (1933), and Spain (1939). Although fascism was primarily a European phenomenon, fascist or fascist-inspired governments also emerged in such places as Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. The alliance between fascist powers, and their aggressive expansion in the late 1930s, fueled the conflicts that culminated in World War II.[Figure 4]November 1922: Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini (1883 - 1945)The origins of fascist ideology are closely related to the devastation in Europe immediately following World War I. The magnitude of human losses and the demands imposed upon national economies placed exceptional pressures on nations such as Italy, Germany, and Japan, which were only partially modernized. Severe economic downturns resulted after war production ceased and eventually worsened after the worldwide depression of the early 1930s. Liberal-parliamentary governments failed to provide relief, leading many to believe that a new political alternative was required either from the extreme left or right. Perhaps the most compelling of the conditions that led to fascism was the sense of national humiliation experienced by those countries that were either defeated, or if victorious, that had failed to gain territories or prestige.In Italy, after 1918, the economy was mired in a slump that produced a wave of strikes and factory occupations by trade unionists. Additionally, the popularity of socialist and communist movements was on the rise. Mussolini's National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista—PNF) emerged as an enemy of the left, and with his private army of ""Blackshirts,"" he led a campaign of violence against socialist leaders, offices, and newspapers. Mussolini also spoke out against the failure of the nation's leaders to secure any territorial gains at the Paris Peace Conference. Eventually, these key issues helped to bring Mussolini to power, through constitutional means, in 1922. Mussolini and his PNF maintained power from 1922 until his fall, as a result of the Allied invasion of Italy, in 1943.In Germany, after 1918, many people felt anger and a sense of betrayal over the military defeat, which they falsely blamed on the nation's new Majority Socialist leadership. The Treaty of Versailles drafted by the victors held Germany responsible for World War I, and the treaty stripped Germany of some territory, limited the size of its armed forces, and demanded reparations payments. During the early 1920s, Germany's economy suffered greatly, and though much of the suffering was self-inflicted, the result was ruinous hyperinflation in 1923 and consistently high unemployment rates. TheNational Socialist, or ""Nazi,"" Partyemerged during these years and gained an audience as a result of these harsh conditions. Its leader wasAdolf Hitler, who appealed to frustrated Germans with promises to restore Germany's pride and bring decisive government. After taking power in 1933, also through constitutional means, Hitler created an artificially inflated economy based on military rearmament as he prepared for German territorial expansion and war. He and his party passed laws to eliminate all political opposition. The Nazi regime also persecuted the Jews through successive legislation that purged them from government, business, and cultural participation.[Figure 5]Adolf Hitler at the time he came to power in 1933. At this early period, many considered him a buffoon, not to be taken seriously. It was not many years before the world realized his full intentions.In Portugal, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar came to power in 1928 after a military coup and ruled Portugal until 1968. His regime embraced some important fascist practices, but suppressed the more radical fascist parties. Following a bloody civil war in Spain during 1936–1939, Gen. Francisco Franco introduced fascism in that country and ruled Spain until his death in 1975. Other fascist governments in Europe were short-lived, such as in Austria (1934–1938 and eventually annexed by Nazi Germany) and Hungary. In countries such as France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom, fascist movements developed with varying degrees of popularity, but never were a real threat to the established power.Fascist IdeologyFascist ideology began with the presumption that the state was the supreme entity to which all other priorities are subordinated, such as individual liberties or democratic freedoms. The state was embodied by a single charismatic leader who had the vision and will to lead the nation to a ""mythical rebirth."" Fascist political ideology was antidemocratic and anti-parliamentary, insisting upon only one ruling party with no political opposition. Fascism was also characterized in this period by the militarization of politics. Internal order was maintained by private armies, who often used violence to eliminate resistance. Fascist leaders usually appeared in military uniforms and orchestrated political functions in regimented and ritual fashion. Violence was commonly celebrated, as fascist leaders believed that a nation could only rise out of the process of struggle.Fascist movements were universally enemies of the Marxist ideologies of socialism or communism. Ironically, fascism had more in common with communism than it did with democracy, however. While they rigorously preserved the private ownership of the means of production, fascists asserted power and direction over private enterprise in matters that affected the state. Fascist movements also typically established a ""corporative"" organization to regulate the economy. Corporations were generally comprised of managers, technicians, labor representatives and government representatives. However, corporations most often became mere instruments of state economic policy.In more radical fascist regimes, like those in Italy and Germany, religion was seen in pragmatic terms as a necessity for mass appeal. Both Hitler and Mussolini eventually made agreements with the Catholic Church, though they kept it well out of politics. In other less ""revolutionary"" fascist regimes, however, the Catholic Church was seen as an important pillar of the state. Catholicism had modest influence on both ideology and policy in the more conservative regimes of Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and Engelbert Dolfuss in Austria. This more integrative approach to religion by a fascist state is sometimes referred to as ""clerical fascism.""The ""nation"" in fascist ideology was chiefly conceived as the collection of traditional ethnicites and cultures of the country. ""Foreign"" elements were considered harmful to national integrity, hence many fascist movements were characterized by anti-Semitism and racial hatred. Nazi Germany was the most fanatical on this point, denouncing Jews and other racial groups as inferior, and taking measures to eliminate them by deportation and violence. Fascist Italy used racial policies sparingly until their invasion of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) in 1935, after which many racist laws were passed against Africans and against the co-mingling of races. After Mussolini's alliance with Nazi Germany in 1939, however, Italy also began to adopt official anti-Semitic policies. Racism and especially anti-Semitism were common among all fascist movements.Even before the defeat of the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) in 1945, fascism was essentially discredited as a political ideology. It has, however, in recent decades, inspired a new generation of ""neo-fascist"" movements. These movements are most often those of the extreme right and attract members primarily concerned with simple race-hatred and anti-immigration policies.[Figure 6]Benito MussoliniThe bombastic Benito Mussolini sought to rule Italy like a modern-day Caesar and even went so far as to attempt to recreate a new Roman Empire in his own image. However, military adventures abroad and an alliance with Adolf Hitler's Third Reich in Germany led to Italy's defeat and Mussolini's eventual downfall.Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was born in Dovis, Italy on July 29, 1883 and was the son of a blacksmith and a schoolteacher. He inherited from his father an abiding interest in the socialist movement and a taste for political extremism. Having briefly worked as a school teacher, Mussolini fled to Switzerland to escape compulsory military service but subsequently returned to fulfill it. Afterward, he worked as a manual laborer, a left-wing agitator, and an effective editor of the official Italian Socialist Party newspaper, Avanti!, in 1912. He broke ranks with the party and was expelled, however, over the issue of Italian intervention in World War I and his desire for Italy to take a more active role. That rejection angered Mussolini, who rejoined the military, was wounded in 1917, and returned to civilian life committed to a new, right-wing ideology—fascism.Mussolini's concept of fascism was his own unique blend of nationalism, imperialism, corporatism, and a political alliance with large business interests. The resulting corporate state that he envisioned was to be organized by groups, rather than by individuals as in a democracy. Thus, the state would deal with such corporate groups of workers and industrialists together, or small farmers and large landowners together, rather than with individuals or class divisions. That new structure of the state was designed to carry Italy into the future, even as it recaptured the glory of ancient Rome. To that end, Mussolini adopted as the party logo an ax bound in wooden rods or fascia—the Roman symbol for authority. In 1919, his Italian Fascist Party was founded officially and began its quest for political conquest in Italy.As Italy slipped deeper into the postwar economic depression, Mussolini's agitation and effective rabble-rousing attracted a large following. His call for strong central authority to restore order was especially well heeded at the polls, and by 1922, that seemingly upstart politician was on the verge of taking control of the government. In October of that year, King Victor Emmanuel III appointed him prime minister in the wake of the fascist coup known as the March on Rome, and Mussolini took command of a large, right-wing coalition. He celebrated his ""conquest"" with a carefully orchestrated parade in which he led paramilitary fascist cadres known as Blackshirts through the streets of Rome.Once installed as ""Il Duce"" (The Leader), Mussolini cracked down on dissent and laid the foundations for an authoritarian state. He also reorganized the economy on a wartime footing, which created badly needed jobs, and began a series of military adventures abroad. In 1935, he launched an attack on the African country of Ethiopia, which he conquered successfully despite an outburst of world condemnation. The following year, he introduced land and air units into the Spanish Civil War in concert with Hitler, another aggressive nationalist whom Mussolini initially disliked and distrusted. Although the ideologies of fascism and Nazism were not exactly identical, the two men saw a need to align themselves against the Western democracies, and in 1936, they signed the Rome-Berlin Axis pact. To placate Hitler, Mussolini also instituted his own brand of anti-Semitism, which was something Italy had been spared thus far. Mussolini anticipated in the event of war that additional conquests and the Caesar-like image that he cultivated would enable him to abolish the Italian monarchy and establish a totalitarian state.Over the next few years, the conquests of Libya, Ethiopia, and Albania made Italy the dominant Mediterranean power. However, Mussolini's tottering military establishment, beset by poor morale and obsolete equipment, had been stretched to the breaking point. When Hitler began World War II in September 1939, the Italian economy was still feeble and unable to sustain any moves toward world domination. Mussolini realized that weakness and delayed declaring war on France until 1940, after the German conquest of western Europe was nearly complete. For that act, British prime minister Winston Churchill branded him ""a jackal,"" as Mussolini appeared to be trying to secure the spoils of war without doing any actual fighting. Italian armies subsequently fared poorly, which underscored the façade of fascist rhetoric. They had to be rescued by Germany from a near disaster in the Balkans in 1941 and also met with embarrassing defeats in North Africa at the hands of the British that same year. Italy sustained further losses through its significant commitment of units to Operation Barbarossa, the German-led invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941.By the middle of 1943, many Italians had had enough of Mussolini. When the Allied invasion of Sicily began in July 1943, both King Victor Emmanuel and the Fascist Grand Council voted to strip Mussolini of his powers, and he was deposed. Mussolini remained under house arrest until that September, when a special German commando operation rescued him. He spent the last days of World War II as the puppet head of a tiny fascist state in northeastern Italy, where his only notable accomplishment was the trial and execution of five council members, including his own son-in-law, who had voted to oust him. When the German defenses finally collapsed, Mussolini and his mistress tried to flee but were caught and executed by Italian partisans on April 28, 1945. Two decades of ideological pretension had finally been shattered, and as a final token of disrespect, Il Duce's body was hung upside down in a public square and interred in an unmarked grave.[Figure 7]Adolph HitlerAdolf Hitler was the charismatic, forceful leader of Germany who led his nation to bloody ruin. In a failed bid for world conquest, his Third Reich overran more land in Europe, Asia, and North Africa than any European leader and led to the deaths of 35 million people. For many survivors of World War II, he remains the personification of evil.Hitler was born in Brannau, Austria on April 20, 1889, the son of a German customs clerk and an Austrian peasant woman. An indifferent, sullen student, he dropped out of high school to work as an aspiring artist but failed to gain entrance into the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. The onset of World War I finally gave him an outlet to vent his anger, and he left Austria to enlist in the 16th Bavarian Infantry Regiment. For four years, Hitler functioned in the dangerous role as a messenger, and he received four decorations for bravery, including the prestigious Iron Cross, First Class. At one point, he sustained serious injuries in a gas attack and spent several months recuperating. Hitler finally mustered out of the German Army in 1919 with a rank of corporal.The German surrender that ended World War I in November 1918 led to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which imposed severe economic penalties as restitution. These penalties occasioned much hardship on the German people and increased their resentment toward the democratic German government for signing such an agreement. Like many disenchanted veterans, Hitler joined the German Worker's Party, which he later helped expand into the National Socialist German Workers' Party, better known as the Nazis. Hitler proved himself a master of oratory and political intrigue and became intent upon seizing the national political agenda. However, when his attempted coup against the Bavarian government (later known as the beer hall putsch) was crushed by the police and military units on November 8-9, 1923, Hitler was sentenced to five years in Landsberg Prison. He only served nine months before a general amnesty was proclaimed, and he used the interval to outline his political philosophy in the book Mein Kampf (My Struggle). In it, he openly flaunted his anti-Semitism, as well as Germany's dire necessity for territorial expansion in the east. However, the book was never taken seriously by critics, and its warning signs went unheeded.The experience of imprisonment garnered Hitler political respectability, and he resolved to overthrow the establishedWeimar Republicby working within the system. His great eloquence and nationalist fervor, as well as the country's general economic unrest, led to increasing Nazi representation at all levels of government through elections held during the 1920s. Hitler's goals received a tremendous boost during the global depression of 1929 as more and more Germans turned to him for leadership in this national economic crisis. By 1932, the Nazis had achieved political control of the government when they became the majority party. Hitler's promises of jobs, security, and a resurrected Germany continued to resonate with the electorate, and in 1933, he came to power by being appointed chancellor by President Paul von Hindenburg. When Hindenburg died the following year, Hitler combined the offices of chancellor and president to become the ""uncontested leader"" (Der Fuhrer) of the German nation.Once in power, Hitler ruthlessly suppressed civil rights, murdered his political opponents within the Nazi Party during the infamous Night of the Long Knives on June 30, 1934, and began to reinvigorate the emaciated German economy. He accomplished an economic revival for the country by expanding the military-industrial sector in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty. As a military leader, Hitler was well versed in military tactics and had a working grasp of military technology. He took a special interest in developing fast tanks and airplanes that would eventually form the basis for the extremely mobile ""blitzkrieg"" warfare of World War II.As Germany grew stronger militarily, Hitler grew bolder on the international stage. He also routinely disregarded sound military advice from his senior generals, whose perceived timidity he regarded with open contempt. In 1936, he marched troops into the Rhineland, restoring it to Germany, and also formed an alliance with Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy. Two years later, Hitler annexed Austria to Germany. At the Munich Conference of September 1938, Hitler convinced Britain and France to allow him to annex the Sudetenland (an area of western Czechoslovakia containing mostly ethnic Germans). Hitler, however, decided after the conference to annex all of Czechoslovakia, embarrassing Britain and France and making all of Europe increasingly wary of his expansionist ambitions. He then stunned the world by signing anon-aggression pactwith Soviet Union leaderJoseph Stalin, which ensured the stability of Germany's vulnerable eastern border. The lack of decisive leadership and resistance to his plans evidenced by the Western democracies did little to discourage Hitler, who by the end of the 1930s was finally ready to gain new territories by force.In September 1939, German forces attacked Poland. That act that precipitated World War II, as Britain and France quickly declared war on Germany in defense of their Polish ally. The newly-developed blitzkrieg tactics worked brilliantly, and Poland was crushed in a matter of weeks. Despite the declaration of war, however, France and England took no offensive action on their own. Hitler used the impasse to shift his forces westward, and by June 1940, France had been conquered, and English troops chased off the continent from their beachhead landing at Dunkirk, in northern France. Owing to the ineptitude of Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering, however, Germany lost the Battle of Britain (the German Air Force's attack to weaken Britain before a land invasion by the German Army), and an invasion of England had to be postponed.Hitler turned his attention to other parts of Europe. Greece and Yugoslavia were subdued, along with most of North Africa, before Hitler committed his single biggest mistake of the war. In June 1941, German forces launched an all-out offensive against the Soviet Union, in open disregard of the nonaggression pact. Initial Russian casualties were colossal, and the Soviet Army was driven back deep into Russia's interior. When Hitler refused to allow his men to retreat from Russia for the winter, the Soviets counter-attacked at Moscow, inflicting the first real German defeat on land.Hitler was so enraged that he sacked most of his leading generals, remained contemptuous of the rest, and appointed himself as commander in chief of the armed forces. For the next four years, Germany waged a losing war in the east against superior numbers of Russian forces, and in late 1941, Hitler compounded his mistakes by declaring war on the United States after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. As a sign of his growing degeneration, he began relying more on astrology than the opinions of his senior military leadership generals when making major decisions.In addition to waging a war of aggression, Hitler embarked on one of the greatest crimes against humanity ever committed. Having espoused the notion of a racially pure (or Aryan) nation, he turned his hatred of Jews into a national policy of mass extermination through the creation of numerous death camps. Jews, Gypsies, and dissenting Christians were deported from occupied countries, used as forced laborers, and then dispatched by gas chambers or cremetoria when unable to work further. Thus an estimated 10 million people (6 million Jews and 4 million others who Hitler considered undesirable for one reason or another) perished in Hitler's ""final solution,"" also known as the Holocaust.[Figure 8]:Children in the Holocaust concentration camp liberated by Red ArmyBy 1944, several attempts had been made on Hitler's life, including one by Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, who exploded a bomb Hitler's East Prussian headquarters. The German Third Reich's days were clearly numbered, but Hitler embarked on several desperate gambits to stave off defeat. He directed the construction of numerous ""super weapons,"" including jet fighters, pilotless bombs, and guided missiles, in a spectacular but futile attempt to turn the tide of the war back to Germany's favor. After surviving a July 1944 assassination attempt, he squandered Germany's final military reserves in the ill-fated Battle of the Bulge in December of that year but failed to defeat the western Allies. By April 1945, the vengeful Soviet Army had all but surrounded Berlin, and Hitler was a virtual captive in his command bunker. He had always declared that Germany would fight ""until five past midnight,"" but on April 30, 1945, Hitler and his longtime mistress, Eva Braun, committed suicide rather than face capture. Thus the vaunted Third Reich, which the Nazis boasted would last 1,000 years, collapsed in utter ruin after only 12 years.[Figure 9]Joseph StalinAn important member of the Bolshevik Party during the Russian Revolution of 1917, Joseph Stalin rose to become the successor to Vladimir Lenin as the leader of the Soviet Union. Stalin shaped the early Soviet Union without regard for the consequences of his actions among the Soviet population and achieved prodigious growth and a police state of unrivaled proportions. He also led his country to victory in World War II as Russian soldiers and civilians absorbed the vast majority of casualties suffered by the Allied forces. Finally, he was one of the primary architects of the postwar world and its bipolar division between East and West.Stalin (which means ""steel"" in Russian) was born Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili on December 21, 1879, in Gori, Georgia. Stalin's parents were simple peasants, and his father supported the family as a cobbler. He had several childhood aliments, including smallpox (which left scarring marks on his face), and a carriage accident that caused his left arm to be permanently shortened and stiffened. Despite his physical aliments, however, Stalin was reported to be in good shape and very strong for his size.Like the majority of the population in the Georgian countryside, Stalin grew up in poverty and uncertainty. He did receive a good education, however, and he did especially well in history and geography. He began to learn Russian at age nine, adding it to his native Georgian. In 1894, he graduated near the top of his class from a local church school in his hometown and received a scholarship to attend Tiflis Theological Seminary, a leading school in Georgian society. At the seminary, Stalin was exposed to Marxism and became involved in revolutionary circles that caused his interest in school to wane. He was expelled from the seminary in 1899.By 1900, Stalin was deeply involved in the Marxist revolutionary movement in Georgia. Following several conflicts with authorities, he was exiled to Siberia. Following his escape from Siberia, Stalin grew involved with the Bolshevik Party and became a member in 1905. In 1912, he was nominated by Lenin to the party's highest governing body, the Central Committee. In the next few years, Stalin's tasks within the party were primarily operational and theoretical. Stalin wrote about how to integrate the various ethnic groups of the Russian Empire into the future Bolshevik state. He would retain this role of a behind-the-scenes operator through the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War that followed.Stalin's chief role during most of the revolution was that of propagandist and supporter of Lenin, especially when the latter was out of the country. Although he remained in the background, Stalin's work was critical to the success of the revolution, and in Lenin's eyes, Stalin showed capable leadership. It was mainly because of Lenin's favor that Stalin gained additional power in the Communist Party. However, other prominent revolutionaries like Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin had doubts about Stalin's personality and abilities. They believed that he was not fit for a leadership role in the new All-Russian Communist Party (later renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [CPSU]).On April 3, 1922, Stalin was nevertheless granted the position that would vault him to the position of leader of the Soviet Union: he was made general secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. From that position, Stalin was able to wield enormous power. In the month after Stalin's appointment, Lenin had a stroke that would ultimately lead to his death less than two years later. Lenin's poor health during that time led to uncertainty among the party leadership. Lenin wrote what came to be known as his Testament, in which he alleged that Stalin was too ""rude"" and ""coarse"" to be an effective leader of the party. In contrast, Lenin praised Trotsky for his leadership and called him ""perhaps the most capable man in the present Central Committee."" Lenin's comments came too late and were somewhat ambiguous on the question of succession. Because of the power he already wielded, Stalin was able to block the Testament from being used against him.Stalin moved carefully to solidify his authority. He ruled the country along with Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, two of Lenin's closest compatriots, following Lenin's death on January 21, 1924. By 1928, Stalin had solidified his grip on power by first moving against Trotsky, whom he saw as his fiercest rival, and then moving against Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Bukharin.From that point on, Stalin ruled without significant obstacles to his authority. His first priority was to create the communist state that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had once envisioned. In 1929, he ordered the first of many five-year plans to modernize and industrialize the Soviet Union. He also ordered the collectivization of agriculture and essentially created large agricultural communities that would feed the growing industrial state. The Soviet Union's economy and industry did grow, but collectivization was achieved only with the dramatic sacrifice of the Russian people. The CPSU, though it ran the government, did not have a large membership when compared to the population of the entire country. Many people resisted the efforts of the government to take their land from them for the purposes of the state. Famines resulted in 1931 and in 1932. Some historians estimate that as many as 10 million people died as a result of collectivization and the resulting famines.Soon after the revolution, Lenin had organized a system of secret police, and that apparatus was greatly expanded under Stalin. In addition, beginning in 1934, Stalin began to move against the old Bolsheviks that he viewed as potential enemies. In the resulting chaos of trials and upheaval, millions of people died in what became known as the Great Purge. In 1938, the terror subsided, but not before millions were sent to the Gulag (a system of Soviet prison camps in the northern reaches of Russia or in Siberia), and all of Stalin's potential or imagined enemies were eliminated. Many of those who were sent to the camps died, in addition to the millions who were killed by execution or famine. In their absence, Stalin was free to develop a cult of personality around himself as loyal party members wrote songs of praise to him and rewrote history texts for school children.In 1939, a new danger threatened the Soviet Union: Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich. Hitler wanted the lands east of Germany as lebensraum (living space) for the German people. Stalin secured a temporary peace for the Soviet Union by signing the Nazi-Soviet Pact (also known as the nonaggression pact) with Hitler in that year. The pact divided Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union. Stalin hoped that this would appease Hitler's appetite for land, but it did not.In the summer of 1941, immediately after the Germans conquered France, Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. The attack caught Stalin and the Soviet Union unprepared. Initially, the attack went very well for the Germans, who made it all the way to Moscow before winter. The harsh Russian winter trapped the Germans, however, and they suffered severe losses from disease and starvation during early 1942.Seizing his chance to turn the tide of the war, Stalin rallied the Russian people by putting aside communist rhetoric and calling on Russian patriotism to save the country from the German invaders. Stalin also drew on the military and economic resources created by the industrialization of the Soviet Union and the assistance of the Allies. Soviet (and Allied) fortunes began to change in 1943 with victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, and by the spring of 1945, the Germans were beaten. The Soviet Union had advanced far into Central Europe during the final months of the war, and Stalin emerged victorious.Through a series of conferences with Allied leaders both during and immediately after the war, Stalin secured for the Soviet Union all territory in Eastern Europe occupied by the Red Army at the time of the German surrender. Stalin saw those lands not only as territory that could be exploited for the benefit of the Soviet Union (much of this territory had been surrendered during World War I when the Bolsheviks withdrew from the war) but also as a buffer zone between the Soviet Union and future attacks from the West. By the late 1940s, the boundary between the Soviet sphere and the nations of Western Europe had been christened the ""iron curtain"" by Winston Churchill, and the Cold War was setting in.During the early 1950s, Stalin's health began to wane. As his mind and body decayed, his suspicion and paranoia of others (which had always been strong) were further amplified. On his death on March 5, 1953, there is evidence that Stalin was planning another purge against his supposed enemies. He died as a result of a brain hemorrhage at the age of 73.[Figure 10]Hideki TojoAn efficient bureaucrat and skilled political infighter,Hideki Tojorose to become the personification of militant Japanese nationalism. He was determined to expand his empire even at the risk of war with the United States.Tojo was born in Tokyo, Japan, on December 30, 1884, into an old samurai family. His father, an accomplished army general, enrolled his son in the Military Academy and the Army Staff College, from which he graduated with honors in 1914. Thereafter, Tojo compiled an exemplary military career. He performed stints as a military attaché in Switzerland and Germany and taught at the Army Staff College before accepting a position within the Army Ministry. By 1929, Tojo had also become commander of the prestigious First Infantry Regiment.At this time, militant factions within the Japanese Army began agitating for a greater say in national policy, especially in light of the 1931 invasion of Manchuria. Tojo cast his lot with the militarists by joining the so-called control faction, which pressed for army modernization and a more aggressive foreign policy stance. Thereafter, he became closely identified with the pro-war element, determined to establish a ""New Order"" of Japanese hegemony throughout Asia.Tojo rose to major general in 1933, but the dominance of the more moderate Imperial Way Faction led to a succession of minor assignments for him. By 1935, he had been transferred from Tokyo to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria as head of military police. He distinguished himself by arresting major conspirators of the February 26, 1936 coup attempt and was rewarded with a staff post within the Kwantung Army. Tojo, an astute political player as well as a competent officer, slowly gathered military support for his aggressive outlook by establishing his ""Manchurian Faction.""This extreme group called for greater Japanese dominance of Asia and outright war with China for control of scarce natural resources. When the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945 erupted in July 1937, Tojo personally led two infantry brigades in a lightning conquest of Inner Mongolia, his only experience at combat in the field. When presiding general Ishiwara Kanji began pressing for containment of hostilities with China, Tojo, who supported total war, worked to arrange his ouster. By then, he was the most influential officer in the Kwantung Army.In May 1938, Tojo capped his military career by returning to Tokyo as army vice minister under Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. He handled his duties with such adroitness that he earned the nickname ""the Razor."" True to form, he opposed the desires of army chief of staff Tada Shun, who sought peace negotiations with the Chinese, and continually pushed for expanded war on the Chinese mainland, and possibly with the Soviet Union. The onset of World War II in Europe only accelerated Tojo's rise to power. He became a vocal proponent of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy and supported Japan's occupation of Indochina following the 1940 defeat of France.At home, Tojo also sought to instill greater domestic harmony by absorbing all parties into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, thereby muting all criticism of foreign policy. Though ostensibly pushing the nation toward conflict, Tojo's popularity was too great to ignore, and Premier Konoe had little recourse but to retain him in his third cabinet of July 1941.Japan's aggressive actions in Asia led to strained relations with the United States. The influential Japanese Navy, never at ease with their army counterparts, began to cast the United States as a much more dangerous adversary than the Soviet Union (which was then being successfully invaded by German forces). Erring for once in assessing an enemy, Tojo temporarily relaxed his hostility toward Russia for what he viewed as the inevitable conflict with the Western democracies. When Konoe steadfastly opposed such a war as unwinnable, deft maneuvering by Tojo caused his cabinet to resign. Tojo himself was then appointed prime minister in October 1941 while also holding the post of army minister. He authorized continued negotiations with the United States for a possible end to its trade embargo with Japan while simultaneously preparing the nation for war. ""If Japan's hundred millions merge and go forward,"" he declared, ""wars can be won with ease."" When it became apparent that U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt would not rescind his demand for a Japanese evacuation of China, Tojo authorized the navy to attack U.S. military installations in Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and elsewhere in December 1941.The initial phase of World War II in the Pacific was characterized by a lightning series of Japanese victories over British and U.S. forces. These successes boosted Tojo's prestige at home and lent greater acceptance to his views on the legitimacy of force. By June 1942, however, the U.S. victory at the Battle of Midway had stopped Japanese expansion in its tracks and commenced a long string of heavy defeats. By 1943, Tojo had assumed the additional post of military procurement minister, and the following year, he became chief of the General Staff. When the fall of Saipan in July 1944 placed Japan in the range of U.S. bombers, however, Prince Konoe arranged for Tojo's dismissal as prime minister.The rest of the war proved anticlimactic as Tojo maintained a low profile until the Japanese surrender in September 1945. When Allied authorities came to his residence with an arrest warrant, Tojo tried and failed to kill himself. Upon recovering, he was put on trial by an international war tribunal for crimes against humanity and was sentenced to death. To the end, the former militarist was contrite and accepted all responsibility for the outbreak of hostilities in order to absolve Emperor Hirohito of any blame. The diminutive, bespectacled, and closely cropped ""Razor"" was subsequently hung on December 23, 1948.[Figure 11]Franklin D. RooseveltThe only president ever to serve more than two terms, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected to office in 1932 and was reelected three more times before he died near the end of World War II. During the 12 years of his presidency, Roosevelt aroused both intense loyalty and opposition. His critics and supporters agree, however, that more than any other president, Roosevelt was the architect of the American welfare state and established government responsibility for individual social welfare. Roosevelt's impact on the United States through his social and economic legislation was huge and lasting.No other president in the 20th century has enjoyed the adulation of the masses to the degree conferred on Roosevelt. He was the first president to use mass communication (the radio) to its full advantage. Through his speeches and famous ""fireside chats,"" Roosevelt sounded like a kind uncle or grandfather to millions of Americans who had never heard a president speak before. Hundreds of thousands sent him letters detailing their plight, asking for his assistance, and thanking him for his help.Born on January 30, 1882, Roosevelt spent his early years at his family estate in Hyde Park, New York and attended the exclusive Groton School before going on to Harvard University and Columbia University Law School. In 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt, his distant cousin and the niece of Theodore Roosevelt. He ran for the New York Senate in 1910. Although a Democrat in an overwhelmingly Republican district, Roosevelt won an impressive victory. He quickly made a name for himself by challenging the Tammany Hall political machine's control over the U.S. Democratic Party. In 1913, he was chosen by Josephus Daniels, President Woodrow Wilson's new secretary of the navy, to be assistant secretary of the navy, the same post Theodore Roosevelt had once held. In 1920, Roosevelt ran as the vice presidential candidate with James M. Cox. Although the Democratic Party lost the election, Roosevelt used the opportunity to establish a national reputation. His political future seemed assured when, in 1921, he was stricken with polio (infantile paralysis) and almost completely paralyzed.For two years, he struggled to teach himself how to cope with the disease and the loss of the use of his legs. Many people thought paralysis would be an insurmountable obstacle to a political career, but instead of giving up, with the help of his wife, Roosevelt developed a bold, active personal style that more than compensated for his inability to stand without assistance. Prior to his illness, Roosevelt had appeared to many of his contemporaries as a spoiled rich man dabbling in politics. Little of his liberalism or political seriousness was apparent before his bout with polio. Once, when asked how he could be so patient with a political opponent, he said, ""If you had spent two years in bed trying to wiggle your big toe, after that anything else would seem easy.""In 1928, with the encouragement of outgoing Governor Alfred E. Smith, Roosevelt managed to win the race for governor of New York. With the onset of the Great Depression, Roosevelt became known for his willingness to use the state government to relieve widespread misery and established a reputation as a compassionate, reform-oriented chief executive. He was reelected in 1930.In many respects, Roosevelt seemed the ideal candidate to recapture the White House for the Democrats in 1932. Still, it wasn't until after John Nance Garner withdrew from the race at the Democratic convention and instructed his Texas and California delegates to vote for Roosevelt that Roosevelt was able to win the nomination on the fourth ballot. Then he captured the attention of the nation by flying to Chicago to become the first candidate to directly address a convention immediately after nomination. He said, ""You have nominated me and I know it, and I am here to thank you for the honor. Let it . . . be symbolic that in so doing I broke traditions. Let it be from now on the task of our Party to break foolish traditions. . . . I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.""During the campaign, Roosevelt promised to balance the federal budget and to provide direct aid to the needy. Although vague on exactly how he would accomplish this, he exuded tremendous confidence that he could do what was necessary to end the depression: ""The country needs, and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.""Roosevelt carried all but six states and defeated Herbert Hoover by more than 7 million votes: 22,821,857 to 15,761,841. Roosevelt also stymied the efforts of the Socialist and Communist parties to capitalize on the economic turmoil gripping the nation. Socialist candidate Norman Thomas obtained less than a million votes, and the Communist Party's representative, William Foster, managed to win only 100,000 votes.Roosevelt, confident of victory, had begun preparing for the presidency months before his campaign and election. Besides a core of loyal political assistants, he had enlisted the aid of a number of college professors, Rexford Tugwell, Adolph Berle Jr., and Raymond Moley—nicknamed the brain trust—to assist him so that once in office he could move swiftly to deal with the national crisis.In his inaugural address, Roosevelt announced that he would call Congress into an immediate special session to obtain the legislation necessary to deal with the banking crisis and the collapse of the economy. He told the nation that if Congress hesitated, he would ask it ""for broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. . . .""The special session of Congress Roosevelt called convened on March 9, 1933 and adjourned on June 16. During that hundred days, more important legislation was passed than in any other comparable period in U.S. history. The three aims of the New Deal were recovery, relief, and reform. The first New Deal legislation concentrated on recovery and relief. To accomplish these goals, Roosevelt had to overcome deep-seated American prejudices against a strong federal government.Two days after assuming office, Roosevelt issued a proclamation closing all of the nation's banks. The special session of Congress passed an emergency banking bill just three days later that gave the president broad powers over the nation's banks, currency, and foreign exchange. Roosevelt went on radio to talk informally to the public about what he had authorized the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and Treasury Department to do and to promise: ""I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress."" The combination of decisive action and personal persuasion worked. Public confidence in reopened banks was restored.Roosevelt also took the nation off the gold standard and devalued the currency by 40% to make American goods more competitive abroad, raise prices of goods at home, and reduce individual debt. As one would anticipate, those in debt applauded, but creditors, such as those holding bonds and long-term mortgages, were enraged.The most popular New Deal measures were those that tried to relieve the suffering of the approximately 25% of the labor force who were unemployed. Roosevelt knew local and state agencies had run out of funds, so he created the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, headed by Harry Hopkins, to give money to local relief agencies. The Civil Works Administration (1933), the Civilian Conservation Corps (1933), the Public Works Administration (1933), and later the Works Progress Administration (1935) were also created to provide temporary relief jobs. Among the other innovative programs were the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA, 1933), which attempted to buoy farm prices by limiting production; the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (1933), which worked to protect people from mortgage foreclosures; the National Recovery Administration (NRA, 1933), which was designed to regulate business competition; the National Labor Relations Board (1935), which was established to guarantee the right of labor to organize; the Social Security Act, which set up an old-age pension system; and the Tennessee Valley Authority project, which brought low-cost power and jobs to millions of people in the Tennessee River Valley area.Although these efforts failed to end the Great Depression, they did provide a sense of the government's commitment to alleviating the suffering and led to Roosevelt's landslide reelection in 1936. They also marked the first extensive use of government's fiscal powers—what would later be termed Keynesian (after English economist John Maynard Keynes) policies—to stimulate mass purchasing and thereby promote economic recovery. Then in 1937, after the U.S. Supreme Court angered Roosevelt by declaring (in 1935) the NRA and AAA unconstitutional, Roosevelt made a costly political blunder by launching a plan to increase the size of the court by six more judges, to 15, so that he could appoint enough new justices to overcome the existing five-member conservative majority. Public reverence for the court and Roosevelt's miscalculation that he could orchestrate the election defeat of congressional opponents in 1938 resulted in his first major congressional setback. This ""court-packing"" plan, combined with the 1937 recession and his apparent unwillingness to curb a wave of sit-down strikes, sharply limited his political power. The Republicans and conservative Democrats won enough seats in the 1938 congressional elections to halt further substantial New Deal legislation, though Roosevelt did put through the Executive Reorganization Act in 1939, which enlarged and strengthened the executive branch of the government. World War II, not innovative New Deal legislation, returned the nation to prosperity.By the time he won reelection in 1936, it was clear to Roosevelt that ominous dictatorial regimes in Japan, Germany, and Italy were going to solve their economic problems through military expansion. Roosevelt hoped to keep the United States out of war, but as World War II began in 1939, he worked to bring about the repeal of the Neutrality Act of 1935 so that he could provide aid to Great Britain. In 1940, he decided to run for an unprecedented third term. Promising to keep Americans out of any foreign wars, Roosevelt easily defeated his Republican rival, Wendell Willkie, 449 electoral votes to 82.After his reelection, Roosevelt obtained congressional approval to provide lend-lease aid to Great Britain and, in 1941, to the Soviet Union. The Lend-Lease Act, passed mainly to allow the British more credit to buy war supplies, provided for the sale, transfer, exchange, or lease of arms or equipment to any country whose defense was vital to the United States. (Total lend-lease aid by the end of the war would amount to nearly $50 billion.) American ships and planes also began convoying supply ships far out into the North Atlantic and reporting German submarine locations to the British Royal Navy. In the Far East, the United States attempted in 1941 to halt Japan's military expansion by announcing a potentially crippling embargo of vital war materiel and oil to Japan. Instead of backing down, Japan launched a surprise attack on December 7, 1941 designed to wipe out the U.S. Pacific fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. In asking Congress for a declaration of war against Japan, the president declared December 7 as ""a date which will live in infamy."" Germany and Italy then declared war, and the United States found itself fighting adversaries in both Asia and Europe.During the war, congressional conservatives managed to dismantle some of the New Deal's innovative programs and forced Roosevelt to orchestrate economic mobilization in a manner that gave considerable authority and profit opportunities to corporate elites. Although severely criticized for various aspects of his direction of the war effort, Roosevelt behaved in his characteristically pragmatic fashion. His goal was to win the war with as few American casualties as possible. To do this, he needed to keep the wartime alliance of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States together until after Germany and Japan were defeated, and he did. At the same time, war-induced prosperity in combination with a widespread belief among Americans that they were fighting ""the Good War"" sustained national unity and enough of Roosevelt's popularity to gain him reelection to a fourth term in 1944.[Figure 12]Roosevelt did not live to see the end of World War II. At the Allied Yalta Conference in 1945, he had been unable to secure a Poland free of Soviet domination, but he did manage to obtain a Soviet promise to join the war against Japan and to participate in the United Nations. Critics attack his refusal to challenge Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, but supporters point out that it was merely an acceptance of political reality—Soviet troops occupied the region. Ordered by his doctors to rest after his return from Yalta, Roosevelt traveled to his favorite retreat at Warm Springs, Georgia, where he suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage and died on April 12, 1945.Perspectives on Roosevelt over the years have varied widely. In the 1930s, his Republican opponents saw him as a virtual socialist. Liberal historians of the 1940s and 1950s lionized him for leading a popular crusade to restore prosperity and justice in America. The radical historians of the 1960s viewed him as a servant of capital, seeking mainly to restore capitalism to health and not truly interested in helping the downtrodden. Still, others have stressed the pragmatic, non-ideological nature of his approach—his willingness to try policies that promised to work and that seemed feasible. None of these interpretations, however, has sought to deny the centrality of Roosevelt and his New Deal in the shaping of modern America.Video AssignmentCapitalism and Socialismby Crash CourseWhat is capitalism?Describe three capitalistic characteristics.Interactive Notebook AssignmentsCreate a foldable for the causes of global recession of the 1930s.

[WHS.28C]ARenewal of Hostilities?It is a commonplace that the war beginning in 1939 is a continuation of the one which ended in 1918, much as European conflicts of the 18th century (such as the Seven Years' War) were often a return to unfinished business. In many respects the commonplace is true, and it is reflected in everyday vocabulary. No other wars are numbered I and II, like kings in a line of succession or blockbuster films in a series.The idea of a progression from World War I to World War II is unavoidable, and several factors make it so. The same nation, Germany, is the participant most actively responsible for each of the two wars. In 1914 this had been a panic reaction, through fear of losing advantage if not moving first. In 1939 it is the deliberate result of the policy of one man, Adolf Hitler.That policy can in many respects be traced back to the after-effects of World War I. Hitler, in his vengeful and expansionist plans for Germany, is able to play on German resentment of the terms imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. He is helped also by another undercurrent from 1918 - the feeling that Germany was not really defeated at the end of that war. Her politicians capitulated before a single foreign soldier had trodden on German soil. If the match were replayed, the result could be different.This sense of aggrieved military self-confidence is to a large extent supported by a striking fact. For eight years of the 20th century (1914-1918, 1941-1945) Germany almost single-handedly holds at bay the three other great European powers, Russia, France and Britain, united against her and for much of the time aided by the USA.Yet within the broad pattern of continuity there are differences. The most profound of these lies in the reasons for the two wars. The causes of World War I are notoriously hard to discern, shrouded in the posturing of imperial powers. It has come to seem the most pointless of conflicts, and until that time the most wasteful of human life. By contrast World War II, even more costly in terms of lives lost, is the war with the clearest moral purpose - to curtail the apparently boundless aggression of Hitler, and to destroy the most successful of the extremist creeds of the 1930s, Fascism.This relates to another distinction. Germany and Austria (linked from 1938 by the Anschluss) have very different partners the second time round, in Italy and Japan. Italy and Germany share the creed of Fascism, and distant Japan is like Germany in being an aggressive and authoritarian military society. Even so, the three make strange bedfellows in the group which is formed in 1936 and becomes known as the Axis.The Axis Powers: 1936In October 1936 an agreement between Germany and Italy establishes much common ground in foreign policy. The arrangement is described by Hitler (in conversation with Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law and foreign secretary) as an alliance between the two most vigorous European nations, rearming faster than any others and capable together of defeating Great Britain if necessary.Mussolini has, this very summer, overwhelmed Ethiopia and proclaimed a new Italian empire. Hitler has been the first head of state to recognize this dubious enterprise. Mussolini now accidentally gives the new alliance its familiar name, describing it as an axis 'round which all those European states which are animated by a desire for collaboration and peace may work together.Before the end of the year the group has a new adherent, animated no more than Italy or Germany by a desire for peace. Japan has recently seized much of northern China and has set up the puppet state of Manchoukuo (the recognition of which is one of the clauses in the 'axis' agreement).In this region Japan has a hostile neighbor in a nation which is also geographically close to Germany and is profoundly loathed by Hitler. Germany in the extreme west and Japan in the extreme east share a hatred and fear of the USSR. This is the basis for the agreement reached between the two nations in November 1936. It is called the Anti-Comintern Pact, to present it as an alliance against international communism rather than a single country.Hitler sees this as the beginning of a military alliance between anti-Communist nations, and it is German policy to tie the knot tighter (culminating in the Tripartite Pact with Italy signed in September 1940). The collaboration within the trio is never very close. Hitler rarely takes Mussolini into his confidence on strategic matters, and Japan operates in a world of its own. Germany enters World War II without the involvement of either of its Axis partners, and ends it with only one of them as an ally.But in the years after the establishment of the Axis, in the late 1930s, it is convenient for Hitler to have such an alliance while he pushes to the limit the patience of the other European powers - benefiting greatly from their instinct that aggression may be calmed by appeasement.Expansion and appeasement: 1935-1939The policy which becomes known as appeasement (the belief that compromise with Europe's fascist dictators will provide the best chance for peace) is associated particularly with the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain. But it already characterizes the foreign policy up to 1937 of his predecessor, Stanley Baldwin. And it is, to a lesser extent, the policy also of the government in France. As the two major European powers in the League of Nations, Britain and France inevitably have to play the leading role in trying to keep Hitler and Mussolini in check.A conciliatory attitude, partly made necessary by the lack of readiness in each nation for another war, is evident as early as 1935. In this year Samuel Hoare and Pierre Laval, foreign ministers of the two countries, concoct a peace plan which would allow Italy to annex large slices of Ethiopia (an independent state, recently invaded by Italian armies).The plan is rejected, but its very existence encourages Mussolini to complete his conquest of Ethiopia. And this de facto state of affairs is soon accepted by an increasingly enfeebled League of Nations. Earlier in the same year there has been another affront to the League's authority. In March 1935 Hitler informs Britain and France that he is creating an air force, is launching a major program of military and naval rearmament, and is introducing conscription.These plans directly contravene the terms of the treaty of Versailles. But in June, to the outrage this time of France, Hoare establishes an Anglo-German Naval Agreement, tacitly accepting the naval aspect of Hitler's plans in return for a pact that German strength at sea will not exceed 35% of the combined fleets of Britain and the Commonwealth.In March 1936 Hitler makes his first military move in defiance of existing treaties. He marches his troops into the Rhineland, a region permanently demilitarized under the terms agreed at Versailles. At the same time he declares (in what is to become a recurring pattern) that this is his last territorial claim.The Spanish Civil War, beginning in July 1936, absorbs much of Europe's attention over the next two years (and provides Hitler's new forces with their first unofficial outing). But from 1938 the German dictator's provocative moves come at an ever increasing pace, each of them taking to the brink the good faith of the appeasers.On March 12 he marches into Austria to reunite the ancient German Reich, an event known as the Anschluss (literally 'joining on'). On the previous day he assures the world that he has no designs on Czechoslovakia. The very next month, in April, he develops a secret plan to annex the western part of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland. He is considerably helped in this ambition by the principles of Versailles, for the region has a predominantly German population. Many of these Germans are already Nazi sympathizers. It is easy to argue, against Czech interests, that the principle of self-determination gives these people the right to merge with Germany. During the summer of 1938 Hitler threatens the Czech government at the diplomatic level, while massing troops on the border.Chamberlain flies from London to confer with Hitler, on September 15 and 22, but by September 27 it seems certain that Hitler's forces will cross the Czech border. France has a defensive treaty with Czechoslovakia. Britain would have to support France. The result would be war.On September 27 Chamberlain broadcasts to the British people, expressing his appalled dismay at being dragged into the affairs of such a 'Faraway country'. The next day he sends a telegram to Hitler, offering to fly again to Germany to discuss the peaceful transfer of the Sudetenland. Hitler postpones the invasion, planned for September 28, and invites Chamberlain, Daladier (the French premier since April) and Mussolini to an immediate meeting in Munich.Munich and after: 1938-1939The discussion inMunichbetween Hitler, Chamberlain, Daladier and Mussolini lasts a little over twelve hours, beginning in the middle of the day on September 29 and ending with the signing of an agreed document at 1.30 a.m. on September 30. Though the dismantling of their country is under discussion, Hitler refuses to allow any Czech representative to take part. Two Czech diplomats sit in a nearby hotel, effectively waiting to be told what has been decided.The conclusion is all that Hitler would wish. The Sudeten areas are to be ceded to Germany during the next ten days. Thereafter plebiscites, organized by the four Munich powers and Czechoslovakia, will reveal exactly where the new border should run.Before boarding his plane, later on September 30, Chamberlain has another meeting with Hitler in which he asks him to sign a joint declaration. This is the document which Chamberlain waves in the air for the cameras on his return to Britain, stating that he has brought back from Germany 'peace for our time... peace with honor.The text above Hitler's signature, on which Chamberlain bases his optimism, declares a determination to remove possible sources of difference between countries 'and thus to contribute to assure the peace of Europe. Chamberlain's hope is that the sacrifice of the Sudetenland has preserved not only peace but the rest of Czechoslovakia.The occupation of Sudetenland brings some 3.5 million people within Nazi Germany, 75% of them German and 25% Czech. But in the event these Czechs are no more unfortunate than their compatriots elsewhere. Three weeks after signing Chamberlain's document, Hitler orders the German army to prepare for a move into the rest of Czechoslovakia. The invasion comes in March 1939. Hitler, in Prague, declares that Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia are now under the protection of the German Reich. But such a brutal betrayal of the Munich agreement transforms the appeasers. When it becomes evident that Poland is the next likely victim, Britain and France are suddenly resolute.Danzig and the Polish corridor: 1938-1939At the very moment of the Munich agreement the Polish government presents its own demand for a slice of Czechoslovakia. There is logic to the claim. If the Sudetenland with its largely German population is to be annexed by Germany, then there is a clear case for the rich industrial area of Teschen Silesia, inhabited mainly by Poles, to be transferred to Poland. On the day the Munich agreement is announced, 30 September 1938, Poland asserts this claim - not for the first time, but now it is instantly acceded to by Czechoslovakia.Unfortunately the ethnic-majority argument has dangerous implications for Poland herself, confronted by a Hitler increasing day by day in confidence. The great port of Gdansk (in Polish) or Danzig (in German) has long been a bone of contention between Polish and German interests. Though first brought to prominence by the Hanseatic merchants, the city and its hinterland (eastern Pomerania, or in its Polish name Pomorze) have historically been part of Poland. But from time to time they have been seized by Germans - first by the Teutonic knights in 1308 - and in recent times they have again been German, from the late 18th-century partitions of Poland until the end of World War I.In 1919 the treaty of Versailles restores Pomorze to Poland and gives Danzig, with its almost entirely German population, the status of a free city within the borders of Poland. This arrangement is probably unworkable at the best of times, and more so from the mid-1930s when Danzig has an elected Nazi city council. Moreover in this area the provisions of Versailles provide a further cause for German grievance. In returning Pomorze to Poland, and restoring her historical access to the sea at Danzig, the treaty has the effect of severing the province of East Prussia from the rest of Germany.Pomorze becomes known in the terminology of the 1920s as the Polish corridor, linking Poland and the sea. Hitler now demands a more literal German corridor - a narrow strip of German territory through Poland to East Prussia. Together with this goes his claim to bring Danzig within the Reich. Both claims are pressed by Hitler with new vigor in October 1938, within days of his winning the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. The Polish government firmly rejects the German demands. Unlike unfortunate Czechoslovakia, this stance wins a positive response from the western powers.In March 1939 Neville Chamberlain, speaking with the approval of both France and the USSR, guarantees help to Poland if her independence is threatened. In April Hitler abrogates his own ten-year nonaggression treaty with Poland, signed in 1934, and secretly orders his army to prepare for a Polish invasion. In May France commits herself to military action against Germany if a conflict begins. But then, in August, Hitler produces a diplomatic bombshell.Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact: 1939In August 1939 a Franco-British military mission is in Moscow trying to persuade Stalin to commit to a treaty for the defense of Poland. Little progress is made, ostensibly because the Poles are refusing to allow Soviet troops to cross their territory to attack Germany. But there is another hidden reason which soon becomes apparent.The Soviet Union and Communism have always been twin forces of demonic evil in Hitler's oratory, but he now proves himself happy to sup with the devil for a very real strategic advantage. It is important to his plans that he shall not be distracted by a major war on his eastern front. In August he opens negotiations with Stalin. Poland is his bait.Stalin, invited by the western powers to join an alliance which will almost certainly involve him in a costly war against Germany for no very evident benefit, now finds himself offered a more attractive option - inactivity and a sizable increase in his territory.It takes the Russian dictator little time to choose. The world is astonished on August 21 by the announcement from Berlin that Ribbentrop is flying to Moscow to sign a nonaggression pact with his opposite number, the Russian foreign minister Molotov. This sudden friendship of two implacable enemies would seem less inexplicable if people knew of the secret protocol which accompanies the pact.The protocol agrees a new set of international boundaries. As modified slightly in a second visit by Ribbentrop to Moscow, in September, it acknowledges Germany's approval of the Russian annexation of the independent nations Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (should any such opportunity occur). And it establishes an agreed division of Poland between Germany and Russia. With this much achieved, Hitler is ready to take his next step - launched, for propaganda purposes, with a grisly little charade.The act of war: 1939During the night of August 31 a group of German soldiers, dressed as Poles, attack the German radio station in the border town of Gleiwitz. They have brought with them a German criminal, taken for the purpose from a concentration camp. They shoot him and leave his body as evidence of the night's dark deeds.Berlin radio broadcasts to the world the news of this act of Polish aggression, together with details of the necessary German response. In the early hours of the morning of September 1 Hitler's tanks move into Poland. His planes take off towards Warsaw on the first bombing mission of a new European war.After a final desperate day of diplomacy, attempting even at this late stage to find a peaceful solution, Chamberlain and Daladier each sends an ultimatum to Hitler. When no answer is received, both nations declare war on September 3.The Polish army, air force and civilian population put up a brave resistance to massive German force - increased, from September 17, by a Russian invasion from the east. Within a few weeks 60,000 Polish soldiers and 25,000 civilians die. By September 28 Warsaw has fallen. Poland is once again partitioned, with an eastern slice going to Russia (as so recently agreed in Moscow) and the lion's share to Germany.The Phony War: 1939-1940In France and Britain the immediate aftermath of the declaration of war is a return to the defensive tactics of World War I. The French rush troops to the Maginot Line, an elaborate complex of concrete fortifications connected by underground railway lines, which has been constructed along the Franco-German border between 1929 and 1938. (It is named after André Maginot, minister of war from 1929 to 1931.)France's border with Belgium, running northwest to the sea, is not similarly protected. So, as in World War I, a British Expeditionary Force is immediately sent across the Channel to dig in along this line.It is not that Hitler is inactive against his new enemies. He is energetically demonstrating, with the deployment of his U-boats (Unterseebooten, or submarines), that Britain can no longer rely on her famed mastery of the seas. The aircraft carrier Courageous is sunk at sea in September, the battleship Royal Oak is torpedoed at anchor in Scapa Flow in October. Hitler also has a devastating new weapon to unveil - the magnetic mine, dropped into the sea from the air to cling to a passing vessel and explode. Inevitably indiscriminate, one such mine sinks the Dutch passenger liner Simon Bolivar in November.Nor is there a lack of conflict in Europe. Stalin, assured of a free hand with Finland by the terms of his nonaggression pact with Hitler, sends troops across the Finnish border in November 1939 (provoking the Russo-Finnish war, also known as the Winter War, in which Finland resists her large neighbor with magnificent resolve). And in early April 1940 the French and British finally agree on their first joint offensive. They will send troops to seize the Norwegian North Sea ports, even though Norway is neutral. The strategic reason is the need to cut the supply of iron ore from Swedish mines to Germany. But they delay in putting the plan into action.Meanwhile on the western front all is quiet.As a result the war acquires in Britain and France a name suggesting a dangerous sense of relaxation. In Britain it is known as the Phony War, in France le Drole de Guerre (the Joke War). By the spring of 1940 the western nations have been able to spend eight useful months building up their armaments. On April 5 Chamberlain is sufficiently confident to declare to the House of Commons that one thing is now certain - Hitler has 'missed the bus'.Four days later a German fleet of warships invades Denmark and Norway. All the important harbors of these two neutral nations are rapidly occupied. Within days British and French troops are on hand to assist the Norwegian resistance. But they have arrived too late and little is achieved.Enter Churchill: 1940The military failure in Norway heightens dissatisfaction in Britain with Chamberlain's conduct of the war. On May 7-8 he narrowly survives a censure debate in the House of Commons (notable for Leo Amery's revival of Cromwell's famous words 'You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing... In the name of God, go!'). Then, on May 10, alarming news from the continent sets the seal on his term as leader.In the early hours of that morning German divisions smash their way into the Netherlands and Belgium. In this new crisis Chamberlain realizes that an all-party government is essential. But the Labor party refuses to serve under a man associated so strongly with appeasement.The leading candidate to succeed Chamberlain in these circumstances is a controversial figure waiting in the wings.Winston Churchill, after a brilliant early career (first as soldier and author, subsequently in several high cabinet roles), has been on the sidelines during the 1930s because of his implacable opposition to appeasement. He has described Chamberlain's 'peace with honor' at Munich as 'a total and unmitigated defeat'.Pugnacious and inspirational, Churchill is the ideal man for the crisis now facing Europe. Appointed prime minister on the very day when Hitler's troops move west into the Netherlands and Belgium, his first task is to confront the famous German blitzkrieg.Netherlands and Belgium: 1940When German tanks cross the border into the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, in the early hours of May 10, it is the start of the most dramatic demonstration of the new German strategy ofblitzkrieg('lightning war'). The technique has been used with devastating success against Poland in September 1939, bringing the fall of Warsaw within just four weeks. But on the western front the defending forces are stronger, the terrain of rivers and canals more difficult, and the speed of success and the range of offensive tactics even more astonishing.German troops arrive out of the blue (dropping by parachute, landing in gliders) to seize strategic bridges, while the armored corps and the infantry move at unimagined speed to separate the defending forces.In the Netherlands, within two days of the start of the invasion, a German division reaches the coast near Rotterdam. The following day, May 13, Queen Wilhelmina and her government depart for England. On the 14th the caretaker government surrenders to the invader.In Belgium the agony lasts a little longer, involving French and British armies as well as the Belgian defenders of the country. On May 14-15 the German advance is briefly checked, but at the same time a development to the south is making this almost irrelevant. Another Germany army, driving west through Luxembourg, reaches the Meuse by the evening of May 12. If the Germans can cross the river, there is a danger that they will cut off the Allied armies to the north.A thousand German aircraft are on hand to assist this river crossing. Ceaseless attacks by dive bombers demoralize the French defenders on the south bank of the river near Sedan, while German infantry cross in inflatable boats. Once on the opposite bank, they establish bridgeheads to which tanks can be safely ferried. By May 15 the vanguard, under Heinz Guderian, is already moving on. On May 17 Guderian crosses the Oise. On May 20 he reaches Abbeville and the coast. Just nine days ago his men were in Germany.To the north the Belgians are still holding out, though not for long (their surrender comes on May 27). But large numbers of British and French troops are now trapped. Their only escape is westwards to the sea. And the Germans are moving up the coast to complete the encirclement.Dunkirk: 1940One part of the Allied force at risk of being captured in Belgium is the British Expeditionary Force. Sent from Britain in September 1939, the BEF has spent the winter dug in along the Franco-Belgian border. Sharing the present danger with them is the French 1st Army.Even before the fall of Belgium, Churchill decides that the only safe course is to evacuate the BEF. In these desperate circumstances the admiralty enlists the help of every small craft in southern England capable of crossing the Channel and going into shallow water off a beach. The result is the most improbable of flotillas, but one which - in conjunction with the ships of the British navy - achieves an astonishing feat, far exceeding expectations.Even so, but for an intervention by Hitler, the miracle of Dunkirk would not have happened. It is the most northerly port in France, the last before the Belgian border. With Belgium about to capitulate, the British and French forces must cross the border and reach Dunkirk to have a chance of escape. They are at least two days away, on May 23, when a German army moving north up the coast arrives near the town. But it stops short. Hitler himself, on May 24, orders its commander to hold back.The reason is not clear. It is possible he wants to safeguard his army for the more important drive south to Paris. It may be that he feels Britain will be less likely to make peace if humiliated by the capture of so many troops.Another reason may be that Goering, in command of the German air force, is urging Hitler to leave it to his pilots to prevent any British rescue attempt. Whatever Hitler's motive, he changes his mind three days later. But by then it is too late. The British and French have reached Dunkirk and have constructed defenses.On May 26 the first troops are embarked. The following day the harbor is partly disabled by German bombs, so the evacuation is extended to a long stretch of beach east of the town, where the civilian craft - the fishing smacks, private cruisers, river ferries - come into their own. For ten days, until June 4, under a hail of bombs and beneath a constant battle between German and British planes, some 860 vessels ply back and forth with their precious cargo.Some 200,000 British and 140,000 French troops are safely ferried across (and another 200,000 Allied troops are taken on board from the Brittany peninsula in subsequent weeks). It is not a victory, but it is a sensational avoidance of defeat. Churchill greets it in his most pugnacious mood, with his famous declaration to the House of Commons that 'We shall fight on the beaches...' And he goes out of his way to praise the young men of the air force fighting above Dunkirk, implying with considerable foresight that the safety of the country may lie in their hands.For Hitler too it may not be a victory, but he has had victory enough in the past four weeks. A million Allied soldiers have been captured by his armies since May 10. And now he has his sights on Paris.The Fall of France: 1940On June 5, the day after the last departures from Dunkirk, the German army turns its attention southwards. Erwin Rommel, whose panzer division has spearheaded the rapid German thrust to the coast, is now again in the vanguard with his tanks. By June 9 the Germans have taken Rouen and crossed the Seine. On June 14 they enter Paris. The French government withdraws to Bordeaux, but the Germans press on relentlessly. By June 16 they are in the Rhone valley.Meanwhile a similar drive southwards on the eastern front makes the famous Maginot Line redundant. Moving behind it to reach the Swiss frontier, the Germans seal off the French divisions which have been attempting to hold these eastward-facing fortifications.This impressive sequence of events tempts a newcomer into the war. In spite of their Axis agreement, Mussolini declined in September 1939 to commit Italy to war as an ally of Germany. Now, nine months later, he realizes that if he is to hope for any of the spoils of victory he had better get into the fray. Just in time, on June 10, he declares war on France and Britain. Within less than a week, on June 16, the French ask for an armistice. Mussolini has not yet managed to launch an attack on southeastern France, but he does so on June 20 - two days before France and Germany sign their armistice.There has been much debate within France whether to seek an armistice or to accept the fall of France and fight on from North Africa. The premier, Paul Reynaud, has long been anti-appeasement and now argues that France must fight on as Britain's ally. But he is in the minority. On June 16 he resigns. He is followed by a figure from the past, Philippe Pétain, one of France's most distinguished and popular commanders from World War I. Pétain immediately asks for an armistice.Before dictating terms, Hitler meets in Munich his very recent companion in arms, Mussolini, to discuss what is to be demanded. Mussolini has wildly ambitious plans. In pursuit of his dream of dominating the Mediterranean, he wants Italy to annex all French imperial possessions in north Africa together with Corsica and the coast of France herself as far west as Nice.But Hitler is in more practical mood. His main concern is to ensure that France does not go on fighting against him as an ally of Britain (with whom he has not yet given up hope of coming to amicable terms). So he intends only to occupy the northern two thirds of France, already in possession of his armies. He will not even commandeer the powerful French fleet and air force, insisting merely that they remain non-combatant (much of the fleet is subsequently destroyed by the British). Italy is to have just the tiny bit of southeastern France which her troops have managed to capture during June 20-22.But if the terms of the armistice are calculated to minimize France's humiliation, the signing of the treaty is stage-managed with precisely the opposite intention. This is to be the moment when Hitler avenges Germany's humiliation of the armistice at the end of World War I, and he plans it with his usual theatrical flair. The railway carriage in which that armistice was signed has been in a Paris museum. It is now brought to the precise place, at Rethondes, used on the previous occasion. Hitler arrives in person on June 22 to savor his triumph. He even sits in the very chair used by Foch. Then he travels to Paris to see the famous sights. The conqueror plays the tourist (it is his first visit).The area left to France, officially neutral under Pétain but in effect a German puppet state, has a curving northern boundary from the Swiss border to the Pyrenees. Vichy is selected as the capital, and the region becomes known as Vichy France.Yet France remains in the war in a different guise. On June 6 Reynaud has brought into his government a young brigadier general, Charles de Gaulle, as undersecretary of state for war. When the armistice is requested, on June 16, de Gaulle crosses to Britain.From there, on June 18, four days before the armistice is signed, he makes a famous radio broadcast to the people of France. He urges them to continue the fight, and declares himself to be the leader of the Free French. Until the liberation of France, in September 1944, he remains in London as the symbol of French resistance (and frequently as something of a thorn in the side of his more powerful political ally, Winston Churchill).Battle of Britain and the Blitz: 1940With the fate of France settled by the middle of June, Hitler turns his attention to Britain. His first task is to achieve a position in which he can ferry troops across the Channel. Dunkirk has proved (if proof were needed) that this will be impossible without command of the air.On July 16 Hitler orders his commanders to prepare for an invasion of Britain, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. But during June there have already been the first attempts to assert control of the Channel. Bombing raids are launched against British convoys. On July 6 German bombers risk a daylight bombing raid as far inland as the barracks at Aldershot, where several soldiers are killed. On July 10 seventy German bombers attack docks in South Wales.In these attacks the Germans are taking a major risk. The British planes are as good as their German equivalents, if not better. The Hurricane can match any German fighter except the Messerschmitt 109 - and this is equaled by Britain's newest and fastest machine, the Spitfire. Over British soil the Spitfire has the great advantage of fighting much closer to its fuel supply than the Messerchmitt. And British pilots, bailing out over home territory, can fly and fight again whereas the Germans face only captivity.Moreover the British enjoy one other crucial advantage. Since 1938 tall thin masts have been constructed at intervals along the British coast. Receiving and transmitting radio signals, they are the world's most advanced application of the new technology of radar.So the British can tell when and where an attack is coming (a significant fact of which the Germans are at first unaware). Even so, with German superiority in the number of planes available, the dogfights and bombing raids of the summer of 1940 are a period of extreme peril for Britain. In recognition of its decisive nature, this struggle in the air becomes known as the Battle of Britain.During August, the most intense period of the campaign, the German purpose is to bomb the radar masts and the airfields of Fighter Command. Sometimes as many as 1500 German planes are involved in a single day's assault. But they lose more of their planes than the British, and they fail in their aim. The radar masts stand. The Hurricanes and the Spitfires keep taking off.In September the German policy changes. Night-time bombing raids on large cities, to destroy the nation's infrastructure and to demoralize the population, now become the main thrust of the attack. The first raid is on London during the night of September 7. The event is described in the Daily Express of September 9 as 'blitz bombing', treating it as part of Germany's strategy of blitzkrieg.The name sticks. Throughout that winter London and other British cities suffer the Blitz. Sometimes, as in Coventry on November 14, the weight of explosives is such that the technique becomes known as carpet bombing (of which the most intense example, later in the war, is the controversial British attack on Dresden during the night of 13 February 1945).But the Blitz fails to break the spirit of Britain's city-dwellers. Even by the time it begins, it seems evident that Hitler will not be able to achieve mastery of the air around or over Britain. As early as August 20, after Britain's young fighter pilots have consistently had the better of their opponents in an intense series of air battles over the previous week, Churchill makes his famous speech to the House of Commons which gives them their lasting name - the Few, to whom so many owe so much.But if Germany has failed to control the air, the outcome of a much longer battle for the shipping routes of the Atlantic is as yet far from undecided.War in the Atlantic: 1939-1941As in World War I, Germany's best chance of starving Britain of supplies is through submarine warfare against merchant ships in the Atlantic. The danger is immediately evident as soon as Britain declares war. On the very first day of the conflict, 3 September 1939, a German U-boat sinks the British passenger liner Athenia with the loss of 112 civilian lives.This is against Hitler's specific order that no passenger vessel shall be attacked (remembering the damage done by the sinking of the Lusitania), but on the military front German U-boats also make an immediate impact. On September 14 a German torpedo strikes the aircraft carrier Ark Royal. It fails to explode. But three days later another British aircraft carrier is less fortunate.On September 17 a German U-boat scores a direct hit on the Courageous. The carrier sinks in fifteen minutes with the loss of 518 men. And on October 14 a U-boat achieves an even more sensational feat. Its captain, with great bravado, steers his way between the ships guarding the entrance to the supposedly secure anchorage of Scapa Flow. Once inside, he torpedoes and sinks the battleship Royal Oak, killing 833 men. He then succeeds in evading his pursuers to arrive back, a hero, in German waters.But the main U-boat target is merchant ships carrying supplies, of which 114 are sunk before the end of 1939. As in World War I, the solution is convoys. But Britain lacks sufficient escort vessels to cover the entire Atlantic crossing. Convoys travel unprotected in mid-ocean.This deficiency is not crucial in 1939 and early 1940, when the U-boats have to travel from their bases in the Baltic round the north coast of Scotland before they reach the Atlantic (the Channel, by far the shorter route, being densely seeded with British mines).But with the fall of France, in June 1940, a long stretch of captured coastline provides much more convenient home ports for the Atlantic hunters. Their range suddenly extends far beyond what the British destroyers can cover. For the rest of that year the tonnage of British ships sunk in the Atlantic is on average five times higher each month than it was in May. And these are the very months when another struggle for survival is taking place in the air, in the Battle of Britain.The Germans, in this same summer, use another effective device to prey on any unescorted Atlantic shipping. Six naval ships are disguised, with cranes and cargo on their decks, to look like unarmed merchant vessels. Trusted by their unsuspecting victims, they dispatch them easily at close quarters.But October 1940 brings the first practical help from the USA. In exchage for the use of eight British bases in the western hemisphere, Britain receives fifty antiquated but serviceable US destroyers for Atlantic duty. They enable the convoys to be escorted further into the danger zone in mid-ocean. And the US soon finds other ways to help the beleaguered British.Lend-lease and the Atlantic Charter: 1941In March 1941 the US Congress, after much pressure from President Roosevelt, passes the Lend-lease Act enabling the president to provide aid to any nation whose defense he believes to be vital to US interests. The first recipient is Britain, but by the end of the war thirty-eight nations have received aid and materials amounting in value to some $50 billion. Some of this is given, some of it is in the form of long-term loans (not until 1972 do repayments finally come to an end).This support is gratefully received. But the more urgent aim of the British leader, Winston Churchill, is to involve the USA as a combatant. The obstacle is the strong streak of isolationism among US voters. Though not shared by President Roosevelt himself, it is a major factor.In July 1941 Roosevelt invites Churchill to cross the Atlantic for a secret conference. The two men have established a warm personal relationship in correspondence over the past year, but they have not as yet met. Churchill eagerly accepts and travels in Britain's most modern battleship, the Prince of Wales, to the rendezvous - in Placentia Bay, off Newfoundland.Churchill's aim is to extract the strongest possible public commitment of the president to the Allied cause. Roosevelt, on the other hand, has to tread a cautious line. He has been re-elected for a third term, in November 1940, on the platform of keeping the USA out of Europe's war. Nevertheless he is profoundly committed to an Allied victory.As a result of these conflicting requirements the document emerging from the talks, published on 14 August 1941 as the Atlantic Charter, is a very general statement of the basic principles of democracy, free trade and international law. Indeed its clauses are subsequently made part of the Declaration of theUnited Nations.But there is one phrase, strikingly different in tone, which serves Churchill's purpose admirably. The two leaders state that they will together seek a peace which will 'for ever cast down the Nazi tyranny'. With this made known to the world, there is no doubting where the USA stands. Churchill can press no further at this stage. And in the event it is something entirely beyond his control which achieves his purpose - in December 1941 atPearl Harbor.Germany and the Balkans: 1939-1941In the late 1930s the countries of the Balkans still harbor many resentments from the past, casting acquisitive glances at patches of their neighbors' territories. The Balkan Entente of 1934 reveals that they also share a wish to coexist in harmony. But from 1938, after the Anschluss, the growing power and aggression of their German neighbor is a factor overriding all others in the region.Most of the Balkan countries are ruled at this time as right-wing dictatorships inclined to anti-Semitism, so there is considerable sympathy for Hitler's politics. Nevertheless the main concern in each nation is to preserve recent and hard-won independence. But by the outbreak of World War II this already seems impossible to achieve.By the autumn of 1939 Czechoslovakia has already been overrun by Hitler. Poland is even now being divided between Germany and the USSR. Moreover there is an unexpected unanimity between the USSR, Germany and Italy. These three nations surround the Balkan countries and Hungary - now isolated by the German occupation of Czechoslovakia to the north.Late in 1940 the familiar Balkan chaos returns to the area, as the nations desperately try to adjust to new pressures. A few months later, by May 1941, the entire region is under German occupation.The jostling for position begins in October 1940 when Italian troops cross the Albanian border to invade Greece - a neutral country, but one which has a guarantee of protection from Britain (granted in April 1939 when Italy seized Albania).Mussolini hopes for a swift success in Greece, but his plans go drastically wrong. The Greeks not only drive back the invaders. They advance into Albania and soon occupy about a quarter of its territory. The initial Greek peril triggers a response from Britain, in fulfilment of the guarantee. And the subsequent Greek success makes Hitler realize that he will have to intervene to rescue his Italian ally.Hitler can only reach Greece through Yugoslavia, which in early 1941 is still trying to preserve a degree of independence. But further north he has secured his position by a mixture of alliances and force.The first German alliance is with Hungary which in February 1939 has signed Hitler's Anti-Comintern Pact, though with considerable subsequent misgivings. In 1940 German forces, allied with local Fascists, bring Romania to heel (Hitler needs the rich Romanian oilfields). Outlying sections of Romanian territory are assigned to Hungary and Bulgaria. In March 1941 an enthusiastic Bulgaria signs the Anti-Commintern Pact. So by the spring of 1941 the regions north of Yugoslavia are all under German control.On 6 April 1941 German troops invade Yugoslavia from Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. Within a few days the country is overrun, after the government and king make their escape. Germany, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria divide up the conquered territory between them. The German army then presses on into Greece, where a small British force has arrived during the previous month. The country is occupied almost as rapidly as Yugoslavia. The British are driven from the mainland by the end of April, and from Crete a month later.The Balkans immediately become the scene of courageous and persistent resistance from partisans, in Greece, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. But the region remains in German hands until 1944.A turning point: June-December 1941By May 1941, after20months of war, almost everything has gone Hitler's way. The nations of continental Europe are now either neutral (Switzerland, Sweden), neutral but Fascist (Spain, Portugal), merged with Germany (Austria), occupied by Germany (Czechoslovakia, Poland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, most of France, most of the Balkans), forcibly neutralized (Vichy France) or allied to Germany (Italy, Hungary, USSR).For a dictator who found himself at war with the world a year or two earlier than he would have wished, it is a most satisfactory achievement. The only failure has been the Battle of Britain, frustrating his plans to cross the Channel - but these were anyway somewhat half-hearted.Admittedly in the very month when this situation is achieved, May 1941, there is one major setback. Germany's newest and most magnificent battleship, the Bismarck, has been launched earlier this year at Kiel. On her first sortie out of the Baltic she is spotted by the British navy. After doing much damage to the pack pursuing her, the vast ship is sunk on May 27 with the loss of nearly all her crew of 2222 sailors.The state of the navy is a sore point between Hitler and his naval commander in chief, Erich Raeder. In the mid-1930s Hitler has assured Raeder, responsible for building up the fleet, that the coming war will not begin until 1944. Raeder therefore regards Germany's strength at sea as inadequate. After the loss of the Bismarck, his naval campaign focuses largely on U-boats.If this is one of the significant turning points of 1941, two more are to follow before the end of the year. The first is Hitler's own doing. The second he has regarded as inevitable sooner or later. But together they will have a decisive effect on the outcome of the war.The first involves Hitler's eastern policy. The USSR, the proselytizing force of world communism, has always been seen by Hitler as his main enemy. And it is to the east, through Poland and into the Ukraine, that his policy of Lebensraum and German expansion has been directed. An attack into these regions is part of his grand strategy. Hitler's skill has been to create the lull, with the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which enables him to secure his western flank before turning his attention eastwards.In this strategy he is, in effect, carrying out the Schlieffen Plan which his predecessors in World War I had been unable to achieve. They failed in the first part of the plan, the conquest of France. With that behind him, Hitler is now ready to move on to stage two - the attack on Russia. His mistake, failing to learn the lesson of Napoleon's campaign, is to believe that this can be a quick affair (though he might reasonably expect the speed of motorized transport to make the difference).When the first Russian winter is bringing home the harsh reality, the other great turning point of 1941 takes place without Hitler even being forewarned. His Japanese allies tell him nothing of their plan for a secret attack on the US fleet in Pearl Harbor on December 7. The events of the second half of 1941 add four major powers to the cast list of the world war. Hitler has dragged in the USSR, just as Japan's action forces the full involvement of the USA. Japan herself, until now engaged only in a regional conflict with China, also becomes a new player on the global scene. And China, as Japan's enemy, is automatically now an ally of the western powers.Thus by the end of 1941 the final alignment of the war is established, in terms of the major powers involved. The Allies are Britain and the Commonwealth, France, the USA, the USSR and China; the Axis powers are Germany, Italy and Japan. (In fact even this alignment is not yet quite final - in 1943 Italy changes sides.)The Russian campaign: 1941-1942As early as the autumn of 1940, when the Battle of Britain casts doubt on his invasion plans across the Channel, Hitler's thoughts turn to an attack on his eastern ally, Stalin. He orders plans to be prepared under the codename Barbarossa. In a directive dated 18 December 1940 he states: 'The German armed forces must be prepared to crush Soviet Russia in a quick campaign before the end of the war against England.'Hitler's intention is that his quick campaign should begin early in May 1941, but precious weeks are lost and it is not until June 22 that three army groups cross the Russian border on a broad front from southern Poland to the Baltic coast.In charge of this campaign are the army commanders who together carried out such a brilliant blitzkrieg to the west a year earlier. The first signs are that they will repeat their triumph. Guderian's armoured corps advances 50 miles in the first day. Four days later, on June 27, he reaches Minsk, 200 miles inside Russia. 300,000 Russians, encircled by the German thrust, are taken prisoner.Guderian crosses the obstacle of the Dnieper river on July 10 and reaches Smolensk on July 16. The route he is taking leads directly to Moscow. Less than four weeks have passed, and 400 miles have been travelled. The Russian capital is now only 200 miles away. There is surely time.Guderian and other commanders urge the strategy of pushing straight on towards Moscow, but Hitler makes a priority of disabling as much as possible of the Russian army. Guderian is ordered to swing south towards Kiev, where a pincer movement succeeds in capturing another 500,000 men (bringing the total number of prisoners in the campaign so far to about a million).The move towards Moscow is resumed in early October. At the end of the month a victory at Vyazma brings another 600,000 Russian prisoners. But Moscow is still 125 miles ahead. The weather is deteriorating. The roads are deep in mud, soon to freeze. A few advance detachments struggle to the suburbs of the capital, in early December. But now the Russian winter has started in earnest.Further to the north another German army, pushing along the Baltic coast, has made similarly spectacular progress in the early weeks of the campaign. Russia's second city, Leningrad, is reached in August. But the Germans prove unable to capture it. They begin a siege, which they hope will be over before the winter. It turns out to last for 900 days, until January 1944.The Germans, confident in their technique of blitzkrieg, have come unprepared for winter conditions. They now receive orders from Hitler that no one is to turn back on any front. Remembering what happened to Napoleon's army on the march to Moscow, the shivering commanders and their men know all too well the hidden strengths brought out in the Russians by depths of winter and extremes of danger.In December the Russians begin their counteroffensive, using divisions brought from Siberia. They make progress, rolling the Germans back on some fronts as much as 150 miles. But in an astonishing feat of endurance, in appalling conditions, the German resolve holds firm. It is fifteen months before the Russians dislodge the enemy from Vyazma, just 125 miles from the capital.So when summer returns, in 1942, the Germans are in place for a renewed offensive. This time it is directed to the south. Hitler has his eye on the oil fields of the Caucasus. Once again, even though the German divisions are much weakened by their deprivations, the assault is carried out with extraordinary verve.The strategy is to capture three salient points which protect the Caucasus, the valuable region between the Black Sea and the Caspian. They are Sebastopol on the Black Sea coast, Rostov at the mouth of the Don and Stalingrad on the Volga.The campaign is launched in early June. A month later the Crimea and Sebastopol are in German hands. Rostov falls on July 25, enabling a German army to press on towards the oil fields. But the third target, Stalingrad, proves elusive. With extreme tenacity, fighting from house to house, the Russians defend this city which protects routes from the north and east. So the Germans begin a second winter on Russian soil, in the blitzkrieg that went wrong.Japan's blitzkrieg: 1941-1942Japan enters World War II with a ruthlessness unmatched by any other combatant, and achieves in a few months a blitzkrieg to rival anything achieved by the Germans. Even Hitler is not informed of the secret strike being prepared. It comes, literally, out of a clear sky.In the early hours of Sunday, 7 December 1941, nearly 400 Japanese planes take off from aircraft carriers in the mid-Pacific. Their target is the American fleet at anchor, and the crews asleep, in Pearl Harbor - the deep-water port stretching inland from Honolulu, in Hawaii. All eight US battleships in the harbor are hit and five are sunk. Eleven other warships sink, 188 planes are destroyed on the ground. More than 2400 Americans die in the sudden attack.On this same day the Japanese launch air attacks on American and British airfields in the Philippines, Guam, Midway, Hong Kong and Singapore, destroying numerous planes on the tarmac. It is a dramatic beginning to a campaign which for the next few months continues at almost the same intensity, by sea and land as well as air.Within the next three days Japanese air strikes off the coast of Malaya sink the British battleship Prince of Wales (which so recently ferried Churchill across the Atlantic) and the battle cruiser Repulse. 5000 Japanese soldiers land on the US base of Guam and rapidly overwhelm it. In Thailand, Bangkok is easily taken. All this happens in the three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and even now there is little slackening in the pace.Hong Kong surrenders on Christmas Day. By then Sarawak is already in Japanese hands. Brunei follows early in the New Year. Before the end of January 1942 the Japanese hold the whole of Malaya, and February brings Singapore, Bali, Timor and the Dutch spice island of Amboina. On March 9 the Dutch surrender their prize possession in Southeast Asia, the island of Java. In early May the USA loses its last foothold in the Philippines.By this time Japanese attention is focused on Burma. The Burma Road, through extremely difficult terrain, is the only route by which supplies from the west can reach Nationalist China. It is crucial to the Japanese to sever this lifeline. By the end of May all Burma is in their hands. China is in danger, and India is threatened.The Japanese next turn their attention to Midway Island, a coral atoll some 1300 miles northwest of Honolulu which the US is developing as an air and submarine base. In early June 1942 a large Japanese fleet, including their four largest aircraft carriers, moves towards Midway. The Americans, anticipating the attack, await them with their own carriers. And for the first time, the tide begins to turn.The assault from both sides is by planes launched at sea. On 4 June US planes succeed in sinking all four of the Japanese heavy aircraft carriers. The Americans have losses too, including one carrier. But the Japanese fleet, suffering a major reverse for the first time in this war, sails for home this same night without even coming close to the mid-Pacific atoll.War in the Mediterranean: 1940-1941In any major European war the Mediterranean is certain to be an important sphere of conflict. It is one in which Britain holds a strategic advantage, controlling the two ocean entrances to the sea through possession of Gibraltar at one end and the Suez Canal at the other.During the first nine months of the war all the countries bordering the Mediterranean are allies of Britain or are non-combatant, until two events in the summer of 1940 transform the situation. France is conquered by Germany and the Italians enter the war on Germany's side. Two powerful navies in the Mediterranean are now threats to British interests - one certainly so (the Italian), and the other potentially so.Hitler, in establishing Vichy France, has agreed to leave the French fleet under French command on condition that its active role is limited to minesweeping. The British, unwilling to trust this assurance, take what they decide to be the necessary action (described by Churchill as 'a hateful decision, the most unnatural and painful in which I have ever been concerned').There is no difficulty in taking control of the many French warships in British ports, or of those moored with the British navy at Alexandria. The hateful decision concerns the major part of the French fleet, including two powerful new battle cruisers, lying in the harbor at Mers el-Kébir in Algeria.On 3 July 1940 a British force blockades the port. The French admiral is given six hours to choose whether to join the British side in the war, to accept a way of mothballing his fleet in safe waters, or to scuttle his ships. If no agreement is reached, the British will open fire.When the deadline passes, in the early evening, the bombardment begins. Much of the French fleet is destroyed, though one of the battle cruisers escapes to the harbor of Toulon in Vichy France. More than 1250 French sailors, who just two weeks previously were Britain's allies, die in the attack - a distressing fact which causes Mers el-Kébir to be among the most widely remembered engagements of the war.The next challenge for Britain in the Mediterranean is the threat from the Italian navy. Italy's most powerful warships are cautious about leaving port, but even there they prove insecure when aircraft from the British carrier Illustrious sink three battleships at their moorings in Taranto harbor in November 1940.However the Italians acquire a clear purpose when the British (aided for the first time by information from Bletchley Park and Enigma) send convoys to Greece early in 1941. In a naval battle off Cape Matapan, the southern extremity of mainland Greece, the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto is severely damaged. She escapes back to port but several other Italian ships are sunk in a British victory which much diminishes any future threat from the Italian navy.However a new danger in the Mediterranean is developing during this same year. The one variety of enemy vessel which can slip unnoticed through the Straits of Gibraltar is the U-boat. By the end of 1941 German submarine activity is having a devastating effect on the British fleet in the Mediterranean.The aircraft carrier Ark Royal falls victim to a torpedo attack on November 13, as does the battleship Barham later in the month. In December a British cruiser is torpedoed, and two other warships fall victim to mines. But the most devastating attack is suffered by British battleships in Alexandria, in a sweet revenge for the Italians.In an exceptionally bold stroke, Italian frogmen penetrate Alexandria harbor. They guide underwater vehicles armed with warheads. In effect they are human torpedoes. They aim well. On 19 December 1941 two British battleships, the Queen Elizabeth and the Valiant, are crippled as they lie at anchor.These cumulative losses severely reduce the power of the British navy in the Mediterranean. And they mean that Hitler can for the first time deliver adequate supplies to his commander in North Africa, Erwin Rommel, who is even now preparing for a great push east.North and East Africa: 1940-1941At the end of June 1940, with Italy in the war and Vichy France neutralized, the Allied position in North Africa is perilous. Britain has some 50,000 troops in Egypt and the Sudan, the region on which the defense of the Suez Canal depends. To the east of the Sudan, in Eritrea and Ethiopia, there are about 200,000 Italian troops. To the west of Egypt some 300,000 Italian troops are in Libya. Beyond them the French colonies of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are out of the combat, following the lead of Vichy France.It looks on paper easy for Mussolini to overwhelm Egypt, bringing great strategic advantage to the Axis powers. But Wavell, the British commander in Egypt, takes a boldly aggressive line against the superior forces confronting him on all sides. And he achieves astonishing results.Wavell strikes first to attack the Italians in Cyrenaica, the eastern province of Libya. Moving armored divisions fast through the desert in a series of surprise attacks from 7 December 1940, Wavell's commanders capture large numbers of Italian soldiers and tanks. On 22 January 1941 they take the coastal fortress of Tobruk. Two weeks later they reach the coast beyond Benghazi, cutting off the Italian army.With the threat from the west eliminated, Wavell turns his attention to the Italian colonies on the east African coast. British troops move from the Sudan into Eritrea and (with Haile Selassie) into Ethiopia. Asmara is taken in April and Addis Ababa in May, clearing the Italians out of both their recently acquired colonies.North Africa: 1941-1943Wavell's rapid success in the Egyptian desert and Libya turns out to be merely the first in a series of see-saw reversals of fortune in this region over the next two years. The central figure is Rommel, the brilliant tank commander who has already distinguished himself in France in the summer of 1940.In February 1941 Hitler realizes that he must extricate his incompetent ally, Mussolini, from the disaster looming in North Africa. He puts Rommel in command of a small armored force of two divisions being shipped to Libya. From March 1941 Rommel carries out the most prolonged feat of inspired generalship by any commander in the entire war, frequently winning victories by tactical brilliance against far superior forces.By mid-April 1941 Rommel pushes the British out of Libya and back over the Egyptian border. In doing so he bypasses and isolates the British garrison in Tobruk. Unsuccessful attempts are made to reach and relieve Tobruk (causing Churchill to deprive Wavell of his Middle East command, replacing him with Claude Auchinleck), until a much strengthened British and Commonwealth army pushes Rommel west again in November.During the winter of 1941-2 both sides receive reinforcements. Rommel's strength remains considerably less than that of the Allies, but it is he who launches the next big campaign in May 1942. It will bring him within an ace of reaching his target, Alexandria.On 21 June 1942 Rommel succeeds at last in taking Tobruk, capturing 33,000 British soldiers and an immensely valuable supply of equipment and stores (his chief of staff reports that during the next stage of the campaign 80% of the German supply system uses captured British vehicles). By now the British are in full retreat. On June 30 Rommel reaches El Alamein, a village on the coast 100 miles west of Alexandria. Mussolini, hearing the good news, flies to Africa to be ready for a triumphal ride into Cairo.But now, as so often in this long North Africa campaign, the tide turns. Auchinleck takes personal command of the situation. At El Alamein he rallies the exhausted and demoralized British troops just sufficiently to achieve a limited purpose.The first battle of El Alamein does not push Rommel back, but it halts him in his tracks. Rommel himself recognizes its significance, but Churchill is disappointed - and uses the occasion once again to change his generals. Harold Alexander is given Auchinleck's Middle East role and Bernard Montgomery becomes commander of the 8th army.The turning point comes when Rommel launches a new offensive, on August 30, which is successfully resisted by the British at Alam al-Halfa. Eight weeks later Montgomery, by now commanding a force which has been built up to far greater strength than Rommel's, is ready to go on the offensive. On 23 October 1942 he launches the second battle of El Alamein.After twelve days of complex tactical maneuvers Rommel is too weak to continue. He beats a retreat so rapid and efficient (700 miles in two weeks) that he leaves few prisoners or supplies in Allied hands. Subsequently, when the 8th army catches up with him to launch new attacks, he withdraws another 550 miles until he is across the border of Libya and into Tunisia.By now it is January 1943 and there is an entirely new element in the conflict. Two months previously British and American forces have landed at several places on the coast of northwest Africa. They are already pressing into Tunisia from the west. The final theatre of war in this long campaign is becoming clearly identified as the region round Tunis.Tunis: 1943The build-up to the Allied attack on Tunis, in May 1943, involves a succession of important new developments. The landing of Allied armies in Morocco and Algeria includes the first major participation by US troops. And since these regions are defended by some 120,000 French soldiers under the command of Vichy France, the invasion poses an unprecedented dilemma and tug of loyalty for the local French commanders.Once the plan of invasion is finalized, in the summer of 1942, Allied diplomats begin the task of trying to discover which of the French generals may have the courage to defy orders and change sides - a difficult assessment, since the negotiators dare not divulge too much of the invasion strategy or timing.To a large extent the Allies fail in this preparatory task. As a result the landing parties are at first vigorously opposed by the French army. The invasion, under the overall command of Dwight Eisenhower, takes place simultaneously on 8 November 1942 on three fronts - near Casablanca on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, and in the Mediterranean at the Algerian ports of Oran and Algiers.There are three days of fighting before the French commanders tell their troops to offer no further resistance. By then the situation in Vichy France is itself undergoing sudden transformation. On November 11 Hitler, abandoning the armistice agreement, sends troops over the border from occupied France. At the same time Italian divisions invade from the southeast.By the end of November 11 Vichy France is a German-occupied territory like any other. From the Allied point of view, there is one major disappointment. The French commanders in North Africa, having themselves changed sides, send instructions to the admiral of the remaining French fleet (mothballed in Toulon) to bring his warships across the Mediterranean.He delays doing so, thus giving the Germans time to mine the exit from the harbor. But there is compensation. Just as the Germans are on the verge of commandeering these valuable ships, the French crews succeed is scuttling the fleet. France is now fully back in the Allied camp, and is about to contribute to one of Germany's major setbacks of the war in the final battle for North Africa.Hitler is constitutionally unable to contemplate failure on the battlefield. So instead of withdrawing his army from North Africa, he decides to strengthen it - even though it is threatened by far superior forces on both flanks. Large-scale reinforcements are shipped to Tunis during the winter of 1942-3, and by February it looks as though Rommel may once again be able to work his magic. Making maximum use of surprise, he manages at first to push west into Algeria against American and French opposition.But his advance falters, while Allied pressure continues to mount on both fronts. To the east the 8th Army is building up strength for a push against a line the Germans are holding from the coast at Mareth, close to Medenine.From mid-March the trap begins to close. American and French forces move east across the border from Algeria. British and Commonwealth troops make their way north up the peninsula towards Tunis. Finally, on 7 May 1943, British armored divisions reach and capture the city. On the same day American and French forces take the nearby port of Bizerte, thus cutting off the escape of more than 250,000 German and Italian troops.The end of this long campaign is a very significant moment in the development of the war. There is now major American involvement. The ambiguous position of France has been abruptly ended. And the loss of North Africa is a blow to Germany's military reputation and self-confidence - just a few months after another major setback, at Stalingrad.Stalingrad: 1942-1943The battle for the city of Stalingrad, bitterly fought from building to building, lasts from August to November 1942. Neither side is able to gain absolute control of the city and evict the other, even though Germany's entire Sixth Army is involved. But the Germans, even if they achieve possession, are in the graver danger. They are fighting far from their sources of supply. And the city they are struggling so hard to occupy may prove a trap, as the Russians are even now planning.A Russian pincer campaign is launched on November 19. It has a simple aim, to encircle the Germans. Just four days later the noose is complete, though not yet tight. It surrounds a large area between the Volga and the Don. Inside it are more than 200,000 of the enemy.The commander of the Sixth Army, General Friedrich Paulus, is well aware that this is the last possible chance to extricate his men. He sends a request to Hitler to begin a withdrawal. The answer comes back: No. Meanwhile German and Italian efforts to break the noose from outside are repulsed with heavy losses. Attempts to break out, and the freezing winter conditions, cause massive losses in the Sixth Army.Eventually, in mid-January 1943, Paulus protests to Hitler that it is beyond human strength to continue fighting in these circumstances. Hitler's reply, as to the commanders near Moscow a year earlier, is that not an inch of ground is to be given up; 'the Sixth Army will do its historic duty at Stalingrad to the last man'.At the same time Hitler promotes von Paulus to the rank of field marshal. No German field marshal, the Führer remarks at the time, has ever been taken prisoner. But at the end of the month (on 31 January 1943) von Paulus, with just 91,000 survivors, surrenders to the Russians. Hitler is apoplectic, declaring himself personally betrayed. He protests that the new field marshal should have taken his own life, like an ancient Roman, rather than face captivity.Hitler's personal obstinacy succeeds in maintaining a German front in Russia for another year and more. But the more significant fact is that his obsessive refusal to yield has now lost him an entire German army - and will soon lose him another, in North Africa.Malta and Sicily: 1942-1943The capture of the German army in North Africa in May 1943 dramatically alters the balance of advantage within the Mediterranean, and brings one immediate benefit for the Allies. It ends the three-year siege and bombardment which has been endured with great heroism by the citizens of the tiny island of Malta.From the entry of Italy into the war, in June 1940, Italian and German planes take off from Sicily on frequent bombing sorties to subdue this small British outpost, of huge strategic importance as the only staging post available to the Allies between Gibraltar and Alexandria and the only base for attacks on the enemy's supply route between Italy and north Africa. At the worst times of the siege, food and fuel can only be delivered to Malta by submarine.The people hold firm and in token of their endurance, in 1942, George VI awards Britain's highest civilian medal for courage, the George Cross, to the entire 'Island Fortress of Malta'. In the summer of 1943, with the whole North African coast now in Allied hands, the strategic importance of Malta is finally reduced and the agony ends.During the North Africa campaign there has been much debate among the Allies as to what should be their next target. Is an attack on Italy better launched from Sardinia or Sicily? The decision is taken for Sicily. On July 9 the southern coast of the island is invaded by landing craft, paratroops and gliders carrying the vanguard of the US 7th Army and the British 8th Army - respectively under the command of George Patton and Montgomery.Italy changes sides: 1943Soon nearly half a million Allied troops are in Sicily. Between them they clear it by August 16 of its German and Italian defenders, though they fail to prevent them escaping the short distance to safety in mainland Italy.This campaign in Sicily (the first penetration by the Allies of any Axis territory) has immediate repercussions in Italian politics. During the night of July 24 the Fascist Grand Council in Rome passes a vote of no confidence in Mussolini. The next day the dictator is arrested on the order of the king, Victor Emmanuel III, who appoints in his place a field marshal, Pietro Badoglio. Badoglio's main task is to extricate Italy from the war. But this is complicated by two factors.One difficulty is that the Germans, whose cause Italy is now eager to abandon, are all around. The other is that the Allies have resolved (at a conference in Casablanca in January 1943) that they will accept only unconditional surrender from any of the Axis powers.Surrender on this basis is an alarming leap into the unknown, but secret negotiations with the Allies (held in Spain and Portugal) bear fruit. On September 8 Italy surrenders. Three weeks later Badoglio signs an agreement committing Italy to change sides. And on October 13 Italy declares war on her recent ally, Germany. But meanwhile the Germans, in possession of most of Italy, have had time to bring in reinforcements and improve their defenses.The shape of Italy, long and thin with a spinal range of mountains, is perfectly designed for defense against an army attempting to move up the peninsula. As a result the Italian campaign is a long and arduous one for the Allies.The initial thrust goes reasonably well. A small force is landed without difficulty on September 3 just across the Straits of Messina, in the toe of Italy. A much larger invasion follows on September 8, up the coast at Salerno. Here there is strong German resistance. Even so, within three weeks the Allies are in Naples. It is only at a point further north, near Monte Cassino, that the slow-down begins.The Italian campaign: 1943-1945About 30 miles up the coast from Naples the Germans create the Gustav Line, a defensive position stretching across the peninsula from the Garigliano River in the west to the Sangro in the east. High on a hill above the Garigliano is the rich and ancient monastery of Monte Cassino, the cradle of the Benedictine movement.The Germans succeed in holding the Allies along this line for six months, from November 1943, in spite of the landing of an Allied force at Anzio, behind the German lines, in January 1944. Anzio remains an ineffective bridgehead until May, when at last an Allied thrust from both directions breaks the German resistance. In the battle the monastery and the nearby town of Cassino are demolished.The multinational Allied force (including US, British, Canadian, French and Polish troops) at last moves fast, capturing Rome on June 5. But the German resistance further north does not collapse as hoped. It is another ten weeks before Florence is taken, on August 13, and by now the Germans have established a strong defensive line just a little further ahead. The so-called Gothic Line stretches through hilly country from Pisa in the west to Rimini in the east. Again the Allies grind to a halt, this time until the spring of 1945.But meanwhile there has been an interesting political development in northern Italy.Since his arrest, Mussolini has been held in various places. At the time of the announcement of Italy's armistice with the Allies, on 8 September 1943, he is being guarded in a small hotel high in the Abruzzi Mountains, northeast of Rome.When Hitler hears the news of Italy's defection, his sense of outrage reinforces the loyalty which he always shows to his incompetent Fascist ally. On September 10 he speaks on the radio to the German nation, describing Mussolini as 'the greatest son of Italian soil since the collapse of the Roman empire'. At the same time he takes more practical steps, ordering a parachute raid by the SS to rescue the fallen dictator.Mussolini might well have preferred a quiet life in a small hotel. After being rescued by the SS, and taken to see Hitler, he is appointed puppet dictator of a new Fascist republic of Italy - meaning now just the northern part still under German control. Mussolini remains a prisoner, for his palace on Lake Garda has the SS guarding it. And he must do whatever Hitler tells him.In the end the SS fail even to give him protection. As the Allies make their final advance up Italy, in April 1945, Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, are captured and shot by Italian partisans. Their bodies are hung upside down from a gibbet in Milan, where nine years earlier he first described his alliance with Hitler as a new axis in world politics.Second Fronts: 1941-1943From the time of the first German onslaught against Russia, in 1941, Stalin has been demanding that Churchill launch a second front across the Channel to divert German troops from the east. Churchill argues in telegrams that such a move would fail because Britain has as yet neither the landing craft nor the divisions to attempt an amphibious assault on a strongly protected coast. Stalin merely reiterates his demand, with the added implication that the British are afraid of confronting the Germans head-on and should derive courage from the Russian example.By August 1942 Churchill becomes convinced that he must meet Stalin in person to persuade him that a landing in France is not possible until 1943 at the earliest - and to bring him news of another landing soon to take place.Churchill flies to Moscow by the only safe route, skirting round the European theatre of war - first to Cairo, then to Teheran and thus, east of the fierce battle developing at Stalingrad, northwest to the Russian capital. In talks lasting five days Stalin still refuses to accept that an immediate invasion of France is not possible, but he responds warmly to news of Operation Torch - the code name for the imminent invasion of northwest Africa by US and British troops.In the event Stalin's expectation of an invasion of France is frustrated even during 1943, a year in which the western Allies decide to make Italy their next target - and in which U-boat activity in the Atlantic is seriously reducing the flow of supplies from the USA to Britain.The German production of bigger and faster U-boats, and the increase of the fleet to 240 under Karl Dönitz (a World War I submarine officer recently given command of the German navy), results in a massive increase in the number of merchant ships sunk in the early months of 1943. The crucial battle of the Atlantic is reaching its climax, and Germany seems poised to win it.But the Allies also have new weapons in the pipeline, including longer-range bombers and short-wave radar (which can detect U-boats without them being aware of it). In April and May 1943 fifty-six U-boats are sunk, with the result that from now on the convoys suffer greatly reduced losses. Just in time, victory in the Atlantic goes to the Allies.There is yet another front on which the advantage swings during 1943. During 1940 the civilian victims of night-time bombing raids have mainly been the inhabitants of British towns. But in 1942-3 the strategy which the Germans first used to such effect is turned upon them with a new intensity.During 1943, from March to July, Britain's Bomber Command mounts an almost nightly campaign against the industrial targets in the Ruhr. And with heavier bombs the technique of carpet bombing, pioneered at Coventry, leads to a devastating new phenomenon, the fire storm. The one that rages through the narrow streets of Wuppertal, during the night of May 29, kills some 3400 people - compared to about 550 in Coventry.The assault on the Ruhr is followed by equally intense attacks on Hamburg (July to November 1943, causing a million people to flee the city) and on Berlin (November 1943 to March 1944). The destruction is devastating, but there is also a huge loss of bombers and their crews. And as with Britain in 1940, the Blitz fails to break the morale of the German people. More effective, at minimal cost, is the brilliantly daring and ingenious raid in which two hydroelectric schemes in the Ruhr valley are destroyed in May 1943 by the bouncing bombs of the Dam Busters.Thus in Italy, in the Atlantic and in the air over Germany there are second fronts of various kinds during 1943. But the one which Stalin most wants, in France, has still not materialized.Churchill accepts reluctantly the need to postpone by a year the planned invasion of Normandy (codenamed Overlord), which cannot happen with any reasonable chance of success before the summer of 1944. Meanwhile Russian advances early in 1944 suggest that Stalin can perhaps succeed without the controversial second front. In January the Russians finally push back the German army besieging Leningrad. On fronts further south they press ahead into Poland, cross the borders of Romania and almost reach Hungary. In April they recapture the Crimea.It is another two months before the western Allies will be ready to cross the Channel. There are alarming signs of a race developing. Which of Stalin's forces or the western Allies will penetrate furthest into central Europe and Germany?The western front: 1944Almost exactly four years after Hitler's preparations to send an invasion force across the Channel to England, the Allies are at last ready to do the same in the opposite direction.D-day(a World War I codename for the launch date of an operation, standing for 'day-day') is fixed for 6 June 1944. On the first day of the operation ships carrying about 130,000 troops (roughly half American, half British and Canadian) assemble to the southeast of the Isle of Wight. From there they move south to the Normandy beaches between Cherbourg and Caen. Another 20,000 men are dropped in by air.Events do not go according to plan. Montgomery, in command of the British sector, expects to take Caen on the first day. He is in for a disappointment.A German panzer division denies Caen to Montgomery for a month. Further west along the coast Cherbourg resists the Americans, under Patton, until June 20. It is mid-August before the Allies begin to make real progress eastwards.The German defense, though extremely effective, is handicapped by several factors. One is a desperate lack of troops in the region, compared to the Allied forces being landed every day. Another is a false optimism on Hitler's part, based on his knowledge that he can now deploy two extraordinary new weapons with which to overawe civilians in Britain. Named Vergeltungswaffen ('reprisal weapons), they become known as the V-1 and V-2 (an aerial torpedo and the first space-age rocket). These are impressive achievements and are terrifying to those in their immediate path. But the damage they do turns out to be relatively insignificant.A third complication is an unwelcome distraction at this time of crisis. On July 20 the Stauffenberg plot nearly succeeds in killing Hitler. More than 5000 people are executed for a link, sometimes remote, with this attempted insurrection. Among them is Germany's greatest general, now commanding the panzer forces in the west. The conspirators' papers reveal that Rommel is in sympathy with their aims. He is arrested and is forced to take poison.And finally, Hitler's character provides a fatal flaw. Once again, as at Stalingrad, he gives the order that no German forces are to withdraw. The result is that the chance to fall back to a strong defensive position is lost. So when the Allies eventually move, they move fast.Patton and the Americans reach Orléans on August 17. A week later a French division is placed in the vanguard, to enter and liberate Paris on August 24. On September 3 the British enter Brussels, and a day later they are in Antwerp. Meanwhile Patton's armies have crossed the Meuse at Verdun and have moved on to the Moselle, near Metz.The Germans are by this time in such disarray that they could offer little resistance if the Allies, with huge superiority in numbers of tanks and aircraft, pushed straight on into Germany's industrial heartlands. But in mid-September the Americans and British pause, partly from shortage of fuel, partly because of a disaster at Arnhem, partly because of differences of opinion in the Allied high command.The event at Arnhem, in mid-September, frustrates the first Allied attempt to cross the Rhine. Montgomery, pushing north towards the river, drops paratroops and gliders on the other side to seize the northern end of the Arnhem bridge. They succeed in doing so, but the main army fails to reach the southern end in time. 7500 men are trapped and captured.This is a tactical disaster, but it is disagreements between Montgomery and Patton which most delay the campaign. Urging different strategies for the next stage, they make incompatible demands on the US general, Dwight Eisenhower, who has been in overall command of the Normandy campaign from the start.Eisenhower tries to find a solution which will accommodate both his army commanders, but precious time is lost - so much so that the Germans, after frantic searches for reinforcements, are able to astonish the Allies by mounting a counter-offensive in mid-December in the wooded region of the Ardennes.Their intention is to break through towards the coast, thus dividing the British army to the north from the Americans in the south. The element of surprise enables three German armies to push west almost as far as the Meuse. But by mid-January 1945 their bridgehead has been contained and squeezed back (the campaign is known as the battle of the Bulge). It turns out to be the last German offensive of the war.Allied leadersYalta and Dresden: 1945A few weeks after the battle of the Bulge the three Allied leaders, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, meet in Yalta, a resort on the Black Sea. Their focus, when they gather on 4 February 1945, is no longer on how to conduct the war in the west. It is on what to do when it is over.Each leader has a different and in many ways incompatible agenda. Roosevelt and Churchill want to secure Stalin's cooperation in establishing the United Nations. Stalin is more interested in extending Russia's borders in the west to those of the old empire, before the humiliating peace treaty made with Germany in 1917 and the subsequent provisions of the treaty of Versailles. This would mean absorbing much of eastern Poland, together with the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.The other main concern of Roosevelt, by now a very sick man, is a swift end to the war in the Pacific against the still extremely powerful Japanese empire. He wants to ensure that Stalin declares war on Japan as soon as the European conflict is over. To achieve this purpose he is in a mood to compromise with the Russian dictator.Churchill, well aware of an obligation to Poland (on whose behalf Britain entered the war), has a greater interest in standing up to Stalin. But militarily he is the weakest of the three leaders. And the unavoidable fact is that the Russian armies have been making much faster inroads on German-held territory than the Allies. They are already occupying Poland, Rumania and Bulgaria. Is Britain on her own likely to use force to drive them out after the war?Compromises are reached. The eastern part of prewar Poland is to be sacrificed to Stalin. In return he offers an olive branch on a topic of great importance to both Roosevelt and Churchill. In keeping with the democratic principle of self-determination, Stalin guarantees that the nations of Eastern Europe will enjoy free postwar elections. Yet all three leaders at Yalta must certainly be aware that this is an empty and unenforceable promise.Stalin also promises to enter the war against Japan within two or three months of the surrender of Germany. In reward for this it is agreed that Russia shall after the war annex some of the territory held by Japan on the Chinese coast, together with the Japanese Kuril islands.The conference at Yalta ends on February 11. Three days later there occurs one of the most controversial Allied actions of World War II. The Russians, with a justifiable fear that Hitler will move divisions to the eastern front to halt their advance, have requested Allied bombing raids in eastern Germany to prevent this happening. The Allies decide that Dresden is the best target for the purpose.The city, famous for the beauty of its buildings, is full of refugees fleeing from the Russians when nearly 800 British bombers strike during the night of 14 February 1945. Their target is the railway marshalling yards which would be of use to German divisions moving eastwards.This initial assault is followed by 450 American bombers the following morning. The result of this vast weight of explosive is a fire storm which rages through the streets of Dresden, destroying eleven square miles of the city and killing countless numbers of people. Estimates have varied widely, but the modern consensus is around 35,000 (by comparison the immediate deaths at Hiroshima will be about 80,000).Done for a military purpose, this calamitous event probably does nothing to hasten the end of the war. For as the three leaders at Yalta are well aware, the end is now clearly in sight for Hitler's thousand-year Reich.Resistance and partisans: 1940-1945Each of the German-occupied countries has a resistance movement of this kind, helped as far as possible by secret agents and weapons parachuted in by the Allies.For several reasons the Communists are the most widely represented group within the various resistance movements. They are themselves targets for extermination by their hated rivals, the Fascists. They have a ready-made political structure in place, from their peacetime activities of subversion and disruption. And they hope to build up a wartime presence in each country which will enable them to seize power when the Nazis are finally pushed out.These international aims place the Communist partisans in direct opposition to the other main group of resistance fighters, those whose devotion is to a nationalist cause and who usually owe allegiance to a government or royal family in exile.The Balkans is the region in which the rivalry between Communist and nationalist guerrillas reaches its most extreme level, to the point of seriously reducing the benefit to the Allies.Yugoslavia has by far the largest resistance movement in wartime Europe. It is so successful that by early 1942 two rival groups are in control of areas large enough to be administered as separate independent territories. The rivals are the Communists, led by Tito, and the Serbian nationalists. Competing with each other as much as against the Germans, they are already struggling for the future control of Yugoslavia. So are two similar groups in Greece, whose enmity is transformed into open civil war once the Germans have been driven out.One of the tasks in which partisan movements can greatly help the Allied cause is in preparing for a future invasion. This element gives particular significance to the resistance movement in France, with a long Atlantic coastline suitable for a surprise landing.There are many separate French resistance movements, among whom the Communists are one of the strongest. But here an umbrella organization, promoted by de Gaulle from London, does succeed in making the rivals cooperate. The French Résistance becomes famous under the general name of the maquis (a word meaning shrubby vegetation or undergrowth, suggestive both of a hiding place and of the nature of an underground movement).On 1 February 1944 the various groups of the maquis are formally merged into a single administrative unit, to be known as the Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur. This grand title (French Forces of the Interior) fits well a new role being prepared for them.When the Allied invasion of occupied France finally comes, in June of this same year, the maquis play a significant role in the interior. In the early stage they carry out acts of sabotage behind the German lines. And then they adjust to the role of conventional troops, helping to drive the Germans further and further back from the liberated areas.The noose tightens: 1945During the spring of 1945 the collapse of Germany comes, after so long, with surprising speed. German commanders in the field, no longer feeling any enthusiasm for a fight which is clearly lost, begin to disregard the stream of hysterical instructions from Hitler to stand firm whatever the cost. To the armies defending the Rhine his order includes the statement that the battle shall be conducted 'without consideration for our own population'.A scorched earth policy within Germany is now the order of the day. All public utilities in the path of the Allies (water, gas, electricity) are to be destroyed. To protests from within his inner group, Hitler replies that if the war is lost, the German nation is lost. There is no need to consider the future requirements of a vanquished people.In this situation, and with Hitler's final reserves sent to the eastern front, the Allies meet little opposition when they cross the Rhine at various points on March 22-4 (first the Third US Army led by George Patton in the south, followed by the British and Canadians in the north). Both groups, pressing on east, reach the Elbe in mid-April. On the way they discover the horrors which bring home to the west, more powerfully than ever before, the true nature of the Nazi regime.On April 10 the Americans reach the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Five days later the British come across Belsen, where there are 35,000 unburied bodies and as many emaciated prisoners still just alive. And these are not even the death camps - merely places where prisoners are subjected to hard work, little food and Nazi indifference.Meanwhile the Russians, pushing westwards, have entered Vienna on April 6. Within three weeks, by April 25, they reach and encircle Berlin, where Hitler is at last beginning to recognize that there can be no miraculous outcome.News of the death of Roosevelt, on April 12, has been enough to make him hope for a sudden reversal of fortune. But on April 29, against his specific orders, the German army in Italy surrenders to the Allies. Hitler also knows that Himmler, his trusted SS commander, has been making peace overtures behind his back. Livid with anger at this betrayal, he now recognizes the end and prepares to meet it. In the elaborate bunker beneath the Chancellery he puts his affairs in order.The traitor Himmler is formally expelled from the party. Admiral Dönitz is appointed as Hitler's successor and the names of his cabinet are selected. Hitler then retires for a while to dictate his last will and testament, a tract of self-justification in which the Jews are still blamed for the war and the Nazi party is urged to continue the necessary campaign against them.On this same day, April 29, in the early hours of the morning, Hitler rewards a woman who has always been quietly faithful to him. He marries his mistress, Eva Braun, following the ceremony with a small champagne party at which Goebbels (the Nazi minister of propaganda) and Martin Bormann (Hitler's secretary and close adviser) are the principal guests.On April 30 Hitler holds his usual daily conference while the Russians, in the streets above, are only two blocks away from the Chancellery. Then Hitler and Eva Braun retire to their quarters. She takes poison, he shoots himself in the mouth. On the following day Goebbels orders SS men to give his six children lethal injections and to shoot his wife and himself.Hitler was appalled that his nation had surrendered in World War I without a single foreign soldier setting foot on German soil. His own unbreakable resolve results in the opposite extreme. When he dies, the enemy is in the heart of Berlin. A week later, on May 7, the unconditional surrender of all the German forces is signed at General Eisenhower's headquarters. May 8 is celebrated by the Allies as V-E Day - victory in Europe.Amphibious war against Japan: 1942-1944Victory in Europe, in May 1945, leaves the Allies free to concentrate on their remaining enemy, Japan. From the summer of 1942 Japan has been in control of a vast swathe of Southeast Asia, captured in the months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. This rapidly acquired territory consists of two main parts.One is a cluster of the many islands, large and small, to the south of Japan, including the Philippines, the Marianas, Borneo, and the islands of Indonesia, half of New Guinea, and the many smaller island groups and archipelagos north of Australia. The other is a new mainland empire consisting of much of the coast of China and the whole of Southeast Asia from Vietnam to Burma.In many respects the whirlwind Japanese campaign of 1941-2 has been too successful. So many conquered territories mean too many fronts to defend. In subsequent years Allied armies tie down Japanese troops in Burma in the west. In the east US ships and planes nibble their way towards Japan through the Pacific islands.The US victory at Midway in June 1942 is the turning point. From then on American pressure in the Pacific is relentless, in the first prolonged example of a new form of combat developed in World War II - amphibious warfare, in which ships, carriers, planes and marines fight together in a closely coordinated effort. The first strategic objective is to secure supply lines between the Pacific coast of the USA and Australia.The first selected target is the island of Guadalcanal, to the northeast of Australia, where the Japanese are building a strong base. From August 1942 there is continuous fighting here on land, at sea and in the air, until at last in February 1943 US forces secure the island.Large numbers of ships have been destroyed on both sides in this six-month engagement, but in terms of manpower the Japanese losses greatly outnumber those of the Americans. A pattern is set, of painful Allied progress (mainly American, sometimes Australian) through the islands towards Japan, with every step bitterly and bravely contested by the Japanese.A significant step in the slow move north towards Japan is the US assault, in February 1944, of a strong naval base in the volcanic cluster of the Truk Islands. Eleven Japanese warships and more than 300 planes are destroyed here, in the first radar-guided night attack. After this it is clear that the next target must be the Marianas, a group of islands which the Japanese rightly regard as a crucial line of defense. From here US planes will be within bombing range of Japan herself.On 15 June 1944 American marines land on Saipan, one of the Marianas. 30,000 Japanese defenders are in secure positions in bunkers and caves. After three weeks of fierce fighting the two Japanese commanders commit suicide (an example immediately followed by hundreds of Japanese civilians, some of them by jumping off cliffs).During this same period there has been a mighty battle at sea, west of the Marianas, between Japanese and American fleets and naval aircraft. It proves a disaster for the Japanese. The action of this two-day Battle of the Philippine Sea begins on June 19 with waves of Japanese planes, 430 in all, launched to attack the US fleet. More than 300 of them are immediately shot down by US pilots. By the end of the next day the Japanese have lost another 100 planes and three aircraft carriers. The American loss is 130 planes and some damage to several of their ships.The capture of Saipan, soon followed by the other Marianas, is of crucial significance. The first large B-29 bombers, developed specifically for this purpose, take off from Saipan on 24 November 1944 on the long trip to bomb Tokyo.With the process of battering the Japanese people into submission now under way, American attention turns also to a nearer target and one closely involved with American history - the Philippines. The campaign to recover them is close to the heart of the US commander, Douglas MacArthur. It was he who had to relinquish them to the Japanese in 1942, after a heroic struggle against superior forces.This time he has the greater might, but the Japanese resist with their usual tenacity. The first US landing is on Leyte on 20 October 1944. Within days sea and air battles are raging in the area (including the first kamikaze attack). Leyte is not secured until Christmas Day. The capital of the Philippines, Manila, withstands a four-week siege before MacArthur enters it in March 1945.Attrition in Burma: 1943-1945While the Allies make gradual progress island-hopping towards Japan, the confrontation between the two sides on the mainland is occurring in Burma. Here the Japanese pose a threat westwards into British India, and from here they could strike north towards the inland capital of the nationalist Chinese leader, Jiang Jieshi (also spelt Chiang Kai-shek). Forced back from the coast by the Japanese invaders, he has made his headquarters at Chongqing, a port on the Yangtze River to the northeast of Burma.During 1943 the only Allied activity in Burma is guerrilla warfare behind the Japanese lines. It is carried out by the Chindits, a combined force of British, Gurkha and Burmese troops under the command of Orde Wingate.Destroying bridges and blowing up railway lines in the Burmese jungle, the Chindits are entirely dependent on supplies dropped from the air - and this method of supply proves crucial when the Allies at last send a conventional army, under William Slim, east from India into Burma. A battle on a double front, at Imphal and Kohima in March-June 1944, is Slim's first success. But the downpour of the monsoon and the jungle conditions make progress slow, and it is not until February 1945 that he is in a position to cross the Irrawaddy. He takes Mandalay on March 20 and moves south to seize Rangoon, just in time before the arrival of the next monsoon.The British recovery of Burma coincides with the American recapture, much nearer to Japan, of the Philippines.Potsdam: 1945The second summit of 1945 is held by the three western leaders in July and August at Potsdam, close to Berlin in occupied Germany. It involves two changes of cast since the gathering at Yalta. The US president is now Harry Truman, following the death three months earlier of Roosevelt. And during the conference a general election replaces Churchill with Attlee, who takes the British chair in the later stages of the discussion.Agreements are reached (and disagreements registered) on many aspects of the postwar settlement. But the main topic is the continuing war against Japan. Stalin is now let in on an important secret - that the USA has developed and in the past few days (on July 16) has successfully tested an Atom bomb in the New Mexican desert.Stalin is not as yet at war with Japan (though he has revoked an existing treaty of neutrality, in keeping with his pledge made at Yalta) so his name is not on a Declaration sent to the Japanese from Potsdam on July 26. It is issued in the names of Truman, Churchill and the Chinese nationalist commander Jiang Jieshi (or Chiang Kai-Shek), who transmits by radio his agreement to the text.The declaration demands unconditional surrender and warns that the Allies will disarm Japan, dismantle the Japanese empire and prosecute war criminals. But it also guarantees that the Japanese will neither be 'enslaved as a race nor destroyed as a nation'. The phrase proves influential in the debate about surrender which occupies the Japanese high command during the final horrifying months of the war.atomic cloud over NagasakiSix months to Nagasaki: 1945The final stage in the US advance towards Japan has begun in February 1945. At this time the B-29 bombers heading for targets in Japan are flying a round trip of some 3000 miles from the Marianas. This distance will be halved if the small island of Iwo Jima, midway along the route, can be captured.The island's obvious strategic importance means that it is defended by numerous heavily armed Japanese troops in a network of fortified rock shelters and caves. US marines meet fierce resistance when they land on February 19. With every yard of the US advance hotly contested, more than 20,000 men are dead or injured on each side before the island is finally in US hands on March 16.On the second day of the engagement a US light carrier is sunk by a desperate new Japanese method of warfare - a suicide attack by a pilot flying a plane full of explosives into the side of the ship. This technique, called kamikaze from a famous event in Japanese history, was pioneered in an attack on a US fleet in the Pacific on 25 October 1944. During the intervening four months it has become a familiar danger, with an apparently unlimited supply of Japanese pilots willing to sacrifice their lives.The largest kamikaze attack awaits the Americans as they take the next step towards Japan. With Iwo Jima secure, attention turns to the island of Okinawa - at a distance of only about 300 miles from Kyushu, the southernmost of the four main islands of Japan.US troops land on Okinawa on 1 April 1945. Five days later no fewer than 355 kamikaze planes are launched against them, while on April 12 the US destroyer Abele is sunk by a further development of the kamikaze weapon. This is the baka, in effect a human guided missile. It takes the form of a glider, packed with explosives and powered by rockets, which is carried by a bomber to near its target. When released, the rockets ignite and the pilot of the baka steers it to the appointed site of his death.Okinawa is in US hands by the end of June, after the most costly battle in the entire Pacific campaign. US deaths are in the region of 12,000, and the Japanese equivalent is possibly more than 100,000.The intended target for the next wave of invasion has been Kyushu. But Japanese defense of such courage and ferocity at every stage makes it more attractive to contemplate bombing Japan into submission. In this context there have been devastating successes, partly thanks to a new US weapon first used in the assault on Iwo Jima - napalm.On 9 March 1945 napalm is used in a raid on a crowded part of Tokyo where the buildings are of timber. In the resulting fire storm some 80,000 people die and a million are made homeless, with a quarter of Tokyo's buildings burnt. In the next few weeks there are similarly heavy raids on all the major cities of Japan. But as with the Blitz on Britain and Germany, there is no sign that these horrors increase the likelihood of Japan surrendering.Japan's surrender is now deemed to require the use of an even more terrifying new US weapon, the Atom bomb. No response is received to the declaration from Potsdam, demanding unconditional surrender (it is later discovered that the emperor, Hirohito, has pressed the case for surrender but has failed to persuade his generals). So President Truman authorizes the dropping of the new bomb.On 6 August 1945 a specially adapted B-29 takes off from Tinian Island, in the Marianas, with the bomb on board. It explodes over Hiroshima at 8.15 a.m., demolishing some four square miles of the city and bringing instant death to about 80,000 people (many more die later from the effects of radiation). Even this does not bring immediate surrender, partly through the rigidity of the Japanese imperial system and partly because the scale of the horror is not immediately realized in Tokyo.A mere three days later a second bomb is dropped on Nagasaki. Between the two events, on August 8, Stalin declares war on Japan and launches a predatory attack on occupied Manchuria. On August 10 Japan announces that the surrender terms specified at Potsdam are accepted.The use of the atom bombs has remained the subject of intense controversy. Would Japan have surrendered if the force of the weapon had been demonstrated on a deserted island? Would conventional warfare have eventually prevailed? Or would either of these courses have led to even greater loss of life by prolonging the war? These are questions which cannot be answered. And on the other side it may be argued that the evidence of Hiroshima made the Cold War, paradoxically, a period of world peace.Video AssignmentWatch:How did Hitler rise to power?by TED EdInteractive Student Notebook AssignmentsCreate a game based on the Second World War.

Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill, prior to and during World War II. [WHS.12B]Investigatethe major causes and events of World War II, including the German invasions of Poland and the Soviet Union, the Holocaust, Japanese imperialism, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Normandy landings, and the dropping of the atomic bombs. [WHS.12C]Locateplaces and regions of historical significance directly related to major eras and turning points in world history. [WHS.16A]Summarizethe development of the rule of law from ancient to modern times. [WHS.22A]Identifyexamples of genocide, including the Holocaust and genocide in the Balkans, Rwanda, and Darfur. [WHS.22D]German-occupied Europe: 1943By the autumn of 1943, the year in which Hitler takes direct control of southern France and northern Italy, the area of Europe occupied by Germany or under puppet rulers is greater than ever before. It includes the entire continental coastline from the Pyrenees to Norway; the Baltic nations from Poland to Estonia; Russia west of the Urals (a line approximately from the Baltic coast near Leningrad to the Black Sea); Czecholsovakia and Hungary (from 1944); and the Balkans.This is the broad canvas on which Hitler is free to put into practice his vision of a new order. In his ideal world Germans will rule as a master race, inferior groups such as Slavs will be made use of as slave labor, and undesirables (Jews, Gypsies, Communists) will be exterminated.These principles underlie the gradual development of the Nazis' murderous schemes. The appalling story unfolds in three separate stages.Before the outbreak of war, with Germany and Austria exposed to the eyes of the world, persecution of Hitler's hated groups is limited to intimidation and violence. His underlying aim is to rid German territory of Jews by terrifying them into moving elsewhere. Visas to leave Germany are freely available, and the willingness to do so can even bring release from a concentration camp. By 1939 more than half the Jews in Germany and Austria have moved to other countries.With the outbreak of war and the closing of borders, escape by emigration becomes difficult (though not at first absolutely impossible). And the German authorities are now free to carry out atrocities unobserved by the wider international community.At first they largely refrain from doing so, at any rate on a systematic basis (the exception is Poland in 1939-40). After Germany's first conquests in the west, in the summer of 1940, the newly occupied countries (Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, northern France) experience the horrors of an alien police state and the anti-Semitic measures long familiar within Germany. But German rule here is less brutally repressive than in the east. And the explanation lies in Hitler's theories.Germans are to rule the united Europe of Hitler's dreams, but they will need assistance. This can only be provided, he believes, by 'Aryans' in the countries to the west of Germany, in those regions settled in the distant past by Germanic peoples such as Franks, Goths, Angles, Saxons and Vikings. He expects, ultimately, cooperation from the west. And he likes to emphasize that the future belongs not to a dominant nation, but a dominant race.By contrast the regions to the east of Germany, inhabited by the Slavs whom he categorizes as Untermenschen ('subhumans'), are suitable only for subjugation. This explains the treatment of the Poles in 1939, and the sudden gear-change in German brutality with the invasion of Russia in 1941.German treatment of Russian prisoners of war symbolizes the change. On June 27, five days after the invasion, the town of Minsk is surrounded. More than 100,000 Russian soldiers are captured and are herded into open fields, surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. They are given no food, and so over the next few weeks, they starve to death. When winter comes, hundreds of thousands of Russian prisoners captured elsewhere on the front are even more easily got rid of. They freeze.[Figure 2]Russian POW 1941Subsequently, the Germans realize that this policy is losing them a valuable reserve of slave labor. It is better that such people should die working for the Reich. In a speech to SS leaders Himmler emphasizes that there is no need to be concerned about 'What happens to a Russian'.The invasion of Russia provides the same turning point in the German treatment of the Jews. In planning the campaign, Hitler and Himmler set up four Einsatzkommando (Special Task Commandos) to follow in the wake of the army. The special task for these SS men is to exterminate two groups of people, the most potent figures in Hitler's demonology, Communist officials and Jews.The work is carried out with ruthless efficiency. Victims are rounded up in villages and towns, are herded into the countryside, are forced to dig long trenches and then are machine-gunned to fall into the ready-made graves. Within the first few weeks of the German presence in Russia tens of thousands of Jews are murdered in this systematic way. It is the beginning of the Holocaust.The Holocaust: 1941-1942The termholocaust, originally meaning a sacrifice consumed by fire in a Greek temple, has been used since the early 19th century for the murder of a large number of people. In recent decades it has acquired a much more specific significance. It now defines, almost exclusively, the systematic attempt by Hitler and the Nazis to exterminate the Jewish people. In the 20th century, which far outstripped all others in the horrors perpetrated by humans on their own kind, the Holocaust has come to stand as the defining atrocity.It is also the atrocity, in the whole of world history, most deliberately planned as the fulfillment of a theory. A flawed and fanatic theory, but one of fatal potency.The theory, articulated by Hitler in Mein Kampf and in frequent ranting speeches, taps into a deep-rooted European tradition of anti-Semitism, blends in some 19th-century fantasies about ethnic identity and racial purity, and finally adds a dash of 20th-century neurosis about socialism. The troubles of Germany and Austria are thereby blamed on a conspiracy of Jews , working like a virus in all spheres of national life to take over the economy and even, through sexual intermingling, to degrade the pure Aryan stock.The misfortune underlying the tragedy of the Holocaust is that someone with these views succeeds in becoming the leader of a powerful nation and then, for a brief while, the conqueror of Europe.From achieving power in 1933 until the outbreak of war in 1939 (an event for which he holds the Jews responsible), Hitler's ambition is to rid Germany and Austria of the nations' long-resident Jews by making them move elsewhere. But with his invasion of Russia in 1941 he begins to conceive a more drastic outcome. The 'final solution of the Jewish problem' (a phrase used in Nazi documents from early in 1942) will be death.Within the first few days of the Russian campaign Hitler's Special Task forces round up and shoot large numbers of Jews. In two weeks of continual executions in early July, in the city of Kishinev alone, one such task force kills 10,000 people.On June 27, in Bialystok, German soldiers chase Jews through the narrow streets around a blazing synagogue, like devils in a medieval scene of the Last Judgement. Hundreds of Jews have been locked into the synagogue before it is set on fire. Once it is blazing, the doors are broken down and others are shoved into the cauldron.But the Nazis are already working on a less visible and more efficient method of achieving their purpose. It is first employed at Chelmno, in Poland, during 1941. Three vans are specially adapted for the killing of people through exposure to lethal gas. During the first six months 97,000 Jews die in these vans. The scheme is considered highly successful. So steps are taken to provide larger-scale death camps with permanent buildings.These death camps are built on Polish or Russian soil. One of the first and largest is Treblinka (in Poland) where more than 750,000 Jews are killed during 1942, most of them brought there from the Warsaw ghetto.[Figure 4]Map depicting locations of camps established in PolandThe placing of the concentration camps in the east, relatively out of sight, is a practical measure of discretion by the Nazi high command. On 20 January 1942 a meeting is convened at Wannsee, a lakeside villa near Berlin, by Himmler's second-in-command in the SS, Reinhard Heydrich. Heydrich has been put in charge of the 'final solution'. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the practical arrangements.He is taken for granted by now in these high Nazi circles that the solution must apply to Jews in all the nations occupied by the Germans. But death camps in France or the Netherlands will be more exposed to view. So it is decided that Jews from such countries must be brought to the Polish camps.Thus begins one of the abiding images of the holocaust - trains of cattle trucks into which Jews are crowded, heading for an unknown destination. The program is described as 'transportation of the Jews towards the Russian East'. Early in 1942 the prospect facing these people is immediate death. But later there are two possibilities - immediate death by gas, or slow death by hard labor and deprivation.The Holocaust: 1942-1945During 1942 it occurs to the Nazis that, as with the Soviet prisoners of war, they are wasting valuable slave labor in their policy of automatic murder of the Jews. So a new form of camp is planned in which those on the trains will be classified, on arrival, as 'fit' or 'unfit' to work. The fit go one way, to the prison huts where they will live for a while as unpaid and underfed laborers. The unfit go the other way, to the gas chambers.The first camp of this kind, ready for use in March 1942, is built at Auschwitz in Poland. An unknown number of people (certainly well in excess of a million) die in this camp in the next three years. More than half of them - the unfit, the elderly, the children - are killed in the four gas chambers within a day or two of their arrival.Those judged fit 'to be worked to death' (a phrase used by Himmler) are put to the service of Germany's war production. Factories are moved from the vulnerable Ruhr, in the west, to the neighborhood of Auschwitz - beyond the range of Allied bombers. Several of Germany's great industrial enterprises tarnish their reputation by benefiting during these years from Jewish slave labor.By the end of 1942 knowledge of what is going on is not limited to those actively involved on the German side. On December 17 Anthony Eden tells the House of Commons in London that reliable reports have been received 'regarding the barbarous and inhuman treatment to which Jews are being subjected in German-occupied Europe'.Eden is putting before the House an international declaration, published on that day, which is more direct in its account of what is actually going on. Issued jointly by the USA, the USSR, Great Britain and the governments in exile of nine occupied European countries, the declaration condemns in the strongest possible terms Germany's 'bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination'.This is straightforward language, in stark contrast to the terms used in Nazi documents about a solution to the Jewish question and journeys to the east. But it is this veil of German euphemism which has enabled a few extreme right-wing historians to argue the preposterous theory that Hitler did not know what the terms meant and so was perhaps personally unaware of the Holocaust.Although by far the largest group of victims to die because of Hitler's theories (about 6 million), the Jews are not alone. Gypsies too are considered a polluting threat to an Aryan society. Rounded up and sent to the camps, most of them are marked down for Sonderhandlung ('special treatment' - another Nazi euphemism, meaning murder). It is calculated that in all some 400,000 Gypsies are killed.Even 'Aryans' are not immune from the obsession with purity and perfection. In 1939 Hitler signs an ultra-secret decree authorizing the death of any German judged 'incurably ill'. This covers mental illness, and the victims (probably about 100,000 in the next two years) are later described as 'useless defectives'. They too should be considered victims of the Holocaust.For Jews in towns orghettos, as for any civilians living in a modern police state, resistance to the authorities is almost impossible (though the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in April 1943 demonstrates how much can be achieved by desperate people fighting in extreme circumstances). The only effective form of resistance in an occupied country is to vanish into a hidden underworld of secret cells, building up a network of like-minded partisans who will undertake any task to frustrate the occupying regime - from securing safe havens for hunted men to acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare.Video AssignmentSurvivor Stories from Treblinka Death Camp - Nazi Jewish Holocaust Documentaryby Keith P.

47,10.1,Cold War,"Berlin Wall, Niederkirchnerstraße, Berlin 1988.Student Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able toDescribethe major causes and effects of the following important turning points in world history from 1914 to the present: the world wars and their impact on political, economic, and social systems; communist revolutions and their impact on the Cold War; independence movements; and globalizationEvaluatehow the outcome of World War II contributed to the development of the Cold WarInvestigatethe factors that contributed to communism in China, including Mao Zedong's role in its rise, and how it differed from Soviet communism.Identifythe following major events of the Cold War, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the arms race.Analyzethe roles of modern world leaders, including Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Lech Walesa, and Pope John Paul II, in the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.Explainwhy communist command economies collapsed in competition with free market economies at the end of the 20th century.Formulategeneralizations on how economic freedom improved the human condition, based on students' knowledge of the benefits of free enterprise in Europe's Commercial Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and 20th-century free market economies, compared to communist command communitiesIndicateexamples of politically motivated mass murders in Cambodia, China, Latin America, the Soviet Union, and Armenia.Development of the Cold WarOnce the Allies had defeated the Axis Powers, the differences between the United States (and Britain) and their Soviet allies became apparent.  Stalin was still afraid of the West while the leaders of the United States and other western countries continued to fear communism. This leads to the question, who was responsible for starting the Cold War between the United States and the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics)? Both countries took steps that were unwise and could be misinterpreted by the other side. Thus it should not be a surprise that two counties with two such different systems came into conflict.[Figure 2]Post-war Allied occupation zones in Germany.Areas of DisagreementRivalry in EuropeEastern Europe was the first area where disagreement arose. Both the United States and Great Britain felt the liberated nations of Eastern Europe should freely determine their own governments. Stalin, fearful that the Eastern European countries would be anti-communist if they were allowed to hold free elections, was against the idea of allowing these countries to determine their own governmental system. Having freed Eastern Europe from the control of Nazi Germany, the Soviet army remained in control of the areas they had conquered.Civil war in Greece created another area of conflict between the superpowers. The Communist People’s Liberation Army and anticommunist forces supported by Great Britain were fighting each other for control of the country in 1946. However, Britain had its own problems and was forced to withdraw support from Greece.The Truman DoctrinePresident Harry S. Truman of the U.S. was concerned by the withdrawal of Britain from Greece as well as the possibility of Soviet expansion into the eastern Mediterranean. Because of this, in 1947, he responded with the Truman Doctrine. This stated that the U.S. would provide money to countries if they were threatened by communism. If the Russians were not stopped in Greece, according to Truman administration beliefs, then the U.S would be faced with the spread of communism throughout the world.The Marshall PlanThe Truman Doctrine was followed in 1947 by the European Recovery Program. A proposal thought up by General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Secretary of State, it is more commonly referred to as the Marshall Plan. The program was designed to restore European prosperity and stability. It included $13 billion in aid for the economic recovery of Europe.  Underlying the plan was the belief that Communist aggression was successful in countries where there were economic problems.The plan was not meant to shut out the Soviets or their economic and politically dependent allies. In fact, they were invited to join but refused to do so. The Soviets believed the Marshall Plan guaranteed “American loans in return for the relinquishing by the European states of their economic and later also their political independence.” In other words, the Soviets believed it was an attempt to buy support.The Soviets responded by creating the Council for Mutual Assistance (COMECON) for the economic cooperation of the states in Eastern Europe. However, this was largely a failure because of the inability of the Soviet Union to provide large amounts of financial aid.By the late 1940s, the split in Europe between the U.S. and the Soviets had become a fact of life. In July 1947, George Keenan, the U.S. ambassador to the USSR, argued for a policy to contain communism within its existing boundaries and prevent it from spreading further. Thus containment became a policy of the U.S.The Division of GermanyGermany's fate became a source of contention between the Russians and the West. When the war was over the Allies divided Germany into four zones, each one occupied by one of the Allies--the United States, the USSR, France, and Britain. Berlin, located deep inside the Soviet occupation zone, was also divided between the four allies.[Figure 3]Map of occupation zones and air corridors during Berlin AirliftThe foreign ministers of the four occupying powers continually met in an attempt to arrive at a final settlement with Germany. However, they had little success and by February of 1948, the three western powers began to make plans to unify their sections of Germany and create a West German government.Of course, the Russians opposed this idea. In an attempt to prevent the creation of this state they implemented a blockade of West Berlin. Soviet forces did not allow trucks, trains or barges to enter the city's three Western zones. Food and supplies could no longer get through to the millions of people in these areas.This meant the Western allies faced a dilemma. No one wanted to start World War III, especially so close after the end of the second World War. However, something had to be done to keep the citizens of West Berlin alive. The solution was to fly in supplies using British and American Air forces--The Berlin Airlift[Figure 4]Unloading planes at Tempelhof Airport in Germany during the Berlin Airlift. Air Force photo.Aircrews from the United States Air Force, the British Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the South African Air Force flew over 200,000 flights in one year, providing to the Berliners up to 8,893 tons of necessities each day, such as fuel and food. As neither side wanted a war, the Soviets did not disrupt the airlift.By the spring of 1949, the airlift was clearly succeeding, and by April it was delivering more cargothan had previously been transported into the city by rail. On 12 May 1949, the USSR lifted the blockade of West Berlin. The Berlin Blockade served to highlight the competing ideological and economic visions for postwar Europe.Air and ground crews of the U.S. Navy Squadron VR-6 at Rhein-Main celebrate the end of the Berlin Airlift, May 12, 1949. Navy photo[Figure 5]Then, in September of 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany, also known as West Germany, was created. The capital city was Bonn. A month later the Soviets responded by creating the German Democratic Republic in East Germany with East Berlin as its capital.The Spread of the Cold WarIn 1949 Communists in China took over the government in their country, further reinforcing American fears about the spread of communism. Later in the year the Soviets also tested their first atomic bomb, leading the U.S. and USSR to engage in an arms race, in which both built up armies and weapons. Nuclear weapons also became increasingly powerful and destructive.Both the Americans and the Soviets believed that an arsenal of nuclear weapons would prevent war. They felt that if one nation attacked the other with nuclear weapons, the second country would still be able to respond and devastate the attacker. Therefore, according to this policy, neither side could risk using their supply of weapons, even though both had stockpiled massive numbers of nuclear bombs.New Military AlliancesThe desire to achieve security during the Cold War led to the formation of new alliances. The first one was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Formed in April 1949 when Belgium Luxembourg, France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, and Iceland signed a treaty with the United States and Canada. All of these nations agreed to treat an attack on one nation as an attack on all nations in the alliance. Within a few years, both Turkey and West Germany joined the alliance.By 1955 the USSR joined up with Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania in a military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact. Europe had again been divided into a hostile alliance system just as it had been prior to the first World War.The Berlin WallIn 1955 a new leader of the Soviet Union emerged in the aftermath of the death of Joseph Stalin. Nikita Khrushchev, new to power in his country, attempted to take advantage of the American concern over missiles to finally solve the problem of West Berlin, a city which continued to be an island of ""western"" style prosperity in the middle of poverty-stricken communist East-Germany.Soviet leaders realized it was necessary to stop the flow of refugees from East Germany through West Berlin. Thus, in August of 1961, the East German government began to build a wall separating West Berlin from the East. Eventually, it would become a barrier of massive size, guarded by barbed wire, machine-gun towers, floodlights, dog-patrols, and even minefields. The wall became a symbol of the division between the United States and the Soviet Union.[Figure 6]Photograph of the Berlin Wall taken from the West side. The Wall was built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from fleeing and to stop an economically disastrous drain of workers. It was a symbol of the Cold War and its fall in 1989 marked the approaching end of the war.The Cuban Missile CrisisDuring the administration of John F. Kennedy, the Cold War confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union reached frightening levels. In the late 1950s Fidel Castro, a left-wing revolutionary leader, came to power in Cuba by overthrowing the regime of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista and created a Soviet-supported communist dictatorship in Cuba. President Kennedy approved a secret plan for Cuban exiles to invade Cuba in the hope of causing a revolt against Castro. The invasion ended up being a disaster. Many of the exiles were killed or captured when they attempted an amphibious landing at the Bay of Pigs.After the invasion, the Soviet Union sent arms and military advisers to the island nation. Then, in 1962, Khrushchev began to place nuclear missiles in Cuba. These missiles were meant to counteract U.S. nuclear weapons placed in Turkey within easy range of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev pointed out ""Your rockets are in Turkey. You are worried by Cuba... because it is 90 miles from the American coast. But Turkey is next to us.""[Figure 7]Meeting of the Executive Committe of the National Security Council- Cuba Crisis. President Kennedy, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. White HouseUnderstandably the U.S was not willing to allow nuclear weapons within such close striking distance of its mainland. In October 1962, Kennedy found out that Soviet ships carrying missiles were heading to Cuba. He decided to blockade Cuba and prevent the fleet from reaching Cuba. This approach meant each side had time to find a peaceful solution. Khrushchev was willing to turn the fleet around and remove the missiles from Cuba if Kennedy pledged not to invade the island nation. Kennedy quickly agreed to this.The Cold War in AsiaNationalists and Communists in ChinaThe revolutionary strain of Marxism had its greatest impact in China. By 1920, the central authority had almost ceased to exist in China. Two political systems began to emerge as competitors for the hearts and minds of the average Chinese citizen: Sun Yat-sen's Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party.By 1921, a group of young radicals, including faculty and staff members from Beijing University, founded the Chinese Communist Party in the commercial and industrial city of Shanghai. Agents from Comintern soon began advising the new party to join with the more experienced Nationalist Party.Sun Yat-sen, leader of the Nationalists, welcomed cooperation. He needed the expertise that the Soviets could provide because his anti-imperialist words had alienated many Western powers. One English-language newspaper in Shanghai said, ""All his life, all his influence, are devaluated to ideas that keep China in turmoil, and it is utterly undesirable that he should be allowed to prosecute those aims here."" An alliance between the two was formed in 1923 to drive out the imperialists and oppose the warlords.The two parties were able to overlook their mutual suspicions for the first three years. They were able to mobilize and train a revolutionary army to march to the north and seize control over China. This Northern Expedition started in the summer of 1926. By the following spring, revolutionary forces had taken control of all of China south of the Chang Jiang (Yangtze), including the major river ports of Wuhan and Shanghai.Tensions between the parties eventually rose to the surface, especially after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925. He was succeeded as head of the Nationalist Party by the general Chiang Kai-shek, who only pretended to support the alliance with the communists. In April of 1927, however, he went on the offensive in Shanghai against the communists and their supporters. Thousands were killed in what is called the Shanghai Massacre. The alliance between the two parties ceased to exist at this point.In 1928 a new Chinese republic was fun dec by Chiang Kai-shek at Nanjing. Over the next three years, he would work to reunify the country. Although he saw Japan as a serious threat to Chinese independence, he believed that they were less dangerous than his other enemy, the communist party.[Figure 8]Location of the first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921, in Xintiandi, former French Concession, Shanghai.Mao ZedongAfter the massacre, some party members fled the mountains region Jiangxi in the south. This group was led by the young Communist Mao Zedong. Unlike other leading members of the party, Mao was convinced that a Chinese revolution would be driven by the poverty-stricken peasants in the country rather than by the urban working class.Chiang now attempted to root out the communists from their urban base in Shanghai and their real base in Jiangxi Province. He was successful in the first part of his task in 1931. Most of the leaders of the party in Shanghai were forced to flee to the base in South China.The Nationalists then turned against Mao's stronghold in Jiangxi. While the Nationalists outnumbered Mao's forces, Mao made more effective use of guerrilla tactics, using unexpected maneuvers like sabotage and subterfuge to fight against the more numerous enemy. Four slogans succinctly describe his methods: ""When the enemy advances, we retreat! When the enemy halts and camps, we trouble them! When the enemy tries to avoid battle, we attack! When the enemy retreats, we pursue!""The Long MarchIn 1934 Nationalist troops, using superior military strength, were able to surround the Communist base in Jiangxi. However, Mao's army, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), broke through the Nationalist lines and began its famous Long March.There was not one Long March, but a series of marches, as various Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. The best known is the march from Jiangxi province which began in October 1934. The First Front Army of the Chinese Soviet Republic, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's troops in their stronghold in Jiangxi province. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) over 370 days.‪[1]The route passed through some of the most difficult terrains of western China by traveling west, then north, to Shaanxi.Finally, Mao's troops reach safety in the hills of Northern China. Of the approximately 90,000 troops who had begun the journey only 9,000 remained. Over the course of the previous year, Mao had been able to take control of the party as its sole leader. To people who lived at the time, it probably seemed that the Communist Party threat to the regime in Nanjing was over. As far as the communists were concerned they were hopeful for what the future could bring.[Figure 9]An overview map of the route of the Long March Red-hatched areas shows Communist enclaves. Areas marked by a blue ""X"" were overrun by Kuomintang forces during the Fourth Encirclement Campaign, forcing the Fourth Red Army (north) and the Second Red Army (south) to retreat to more western enclaves (open dotted lines). The solid dotted line is the route of the First Red Army from Jiangxi. The withdrawal of all three Red Armies ends in the northeast enclave of Shaanxi.China Under Chang Kai-ShekWhile trying to destroy the communist threat Chiang was also trying to build a new nation. Chiang publicly declared his commitment to the plans of Sun Yat-sen which called for the creation of a Republic. However, first, there would, of course, be a transition period. In the words of Sun Yat-sen:""China... needs a republican government just as a boy needs school. As a schoolboy must have good teachers and helpful friends, so the Chinese people, being for the first time under Republican rule, must have a farsighted revolutionary government for their training... without this disorder will be unavoidable.""In keeping with this program, Chiang announced a period of political tutelage or training to prepare the Chinese people for a final stage of constitutional government. At the same time, the Nationalists would use the power of a dictator to implement a land-reform program as well as modernize the economy.It would, however, take more than plans on paper to create a new nation. The Chinese economy, as well as the political and social fabric, had been long neglected and damaged by years of civil war and internal strife. Most of the people who lived in the countryside were tired of warfare and civil strife. The peasants, making up 80% of the population, were mostly illiterate and still very poor.One positive was that a westernized middle class had begun to form in the urban areas of the nation. This is where the new Nanjing overmen found much of its support. However, the newly westernized elite pursued the middle-class values of individual advancement and material accumulation and had few, if any, links to the peasants in the countryside.[Figure 10]Chiang Kai-shekThe decade of 1928 to 1937 saw some aspects of foreign imperialism, concessions, and privileges in China, moderated through diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed. Efforts were made towards improving education standards; and, in an effort to unify Chinese society, the New Life Movement was launched to encourage Confucian moral values and personal discipline.Guoyu(""National language""), was promoted as a standard tongue, and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) was used to encourage a sense of Chinese nationalism in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central governmentAny successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The 1930 Central Plains War alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost 250,000 casualties on both sides. In 1931, Hu Hanmin, Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under house arrest, but he was released after national condemnation after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in Guangzhou. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Guangzhou government and Chiang's Nationalist government. Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord Zhang Xueliang, who had previously supported Hu Hanmin.Chinese Civil WarBy 1945, there were two Chinese governments, the Nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists led by Mao.By the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the balance of power in China's civil war had shifted in favor of the Communists. Their main force grew to 1.2 million troops, with a militia of 2 million. Their ""Liberated Zone"" contained 19 base areas, including one-quarter of the country's territory and one-third of its population; this included many important towns and cities. Moreover, the Soviet Union turned over all of its captured Japanese weapons and a substantial amount of their own supplies to the Communists, who received Northeastern China from the Soviets as well.‪In March 1946, despite repeated requests from Chiang, the Soviet Red Army under the command of Marshal Malinovsky continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria while Malinovsky secretly told the CPC forces to move in behind them, because Stalin wanted Mao to have firm control of at least the northern part of Manchuria before the complete withdrawal of the Soviets, which led to full-scale war for the control of the Northeast. These favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leadership: the more hard-line faction finally gained the upper hand and defeated the opportunists.‪Prior to giving control to Communist leaders, on March 27 Soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the Nationalist Party in Manchuria.‪Using the pretext of ""receiving the Japanese surrender"", business interests within the KMT government occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties, which had previously been seized by the Imperial Japanese Army.‪They also conscripted troops at a brutal pace from the civilian population and hoarded supplies, preparing for a resumption of war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as Shanghai, where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to 37.5%.‪The US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. Over 50,000 US Marines were sent to guard strategic sites, and 100,000 US troops were sent to Shandong. The US equipped and trained over 500,000 KMT troops, and transported KMT forces to occupy newly liberated zones as well as to contain Communist-controlled areas.‪American aid included substantial amounts of both new and surplus military supplies; additionally, loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars were made to the KMT.‪Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the US—most of which was military aid.‪Knowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CPC executed a ""passive defense"" strategy. It avoided the strong points of the KMT army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces. In most cases, the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. The CPC also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible. This tactic seemed to be successful; after a year, the power balance became more favorable to the CPC. They wiped out 1.12 million KMT troops, while their strength grew to about two million men.‪In March 1947 the KMT achieved a symbolic victory by seizing the CPC capital of Yan'an.‪Soon afterward the Communists counterattacked; on 30 June 1947 CPC troops crossed the Huanghe River and moved to the Dabie Mountains area, restored and developed the Central Plain. Concurrently, Communist forces in Northeastern China, North China, and East China began to counterattack as well.‪By late 1948 the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of Shenyang and Changchun and seized control of the Northeast after suffering numerous setbacks while trying to take the cities, with the decisive Liaoshen Campaign.‪The New 1st Army, regarded as the best KMT army, was forced to surrender after the CPC conducted a brutal six-month siege of Changchun that resulted in more than 150,000 civilian deaths from starvation.‪The capture of large KMT units provided the CPC with the tanks, heavy artillery and other combined-arms assets needed to prosecute offensive operations south of the Great Wall. By April 1948 the city of Luoyang fell, cutting the KMT army off from Xi'an.‪Following a fierce battle, the CPC captured Jinan and Shandong province on September 24, 1948. The Huaihai Campaign of late 1948 and early 1949 secured east-central China for the CPC.‪The outcome of these encounters was decisive for the military outcome of the civil war.‪The Pingjin Campaign resulted in the Communist conquest of northern China. It lasted 64 days, from November 21, 1948, to January 31, 1949.‪The PLA suffered heavy casualties while securing Zhangjiakou, Tianjin along with its port and garrison at Dagu and Beiping.‪The CPC brought 890,000 troops from the northeast to oppose some 600,000 KMT troops.‪There were 40,000 CPC casualties at Zhangjiakou alone. They in turn killed, wounded or captured some 520,000 KMT during the campaign.‪On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed thePeople's Republic of Chinawith its capital at Beiping, which was renamedBeijing. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately two million Nationalist Chinese retreated frommainland Chinato the island ofTaiwanin December after the loss of Sichuan. There remained only isolated pockets of resistance, notably inSichuan(ending soon after the fall ofChengduon December 10, 1949) and in the far south.[Figure 11]Mao Zedong proclaiming the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949.The People's Republic of China (1949-present)Major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore, reducing the ROC's territory to only Taiwan, Hainan, and their surrounding islands. On 1 October 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army succeeded in capturing Hainan from the ROC and occupying Tibet. However, remaining Nationalist forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.Mao's regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the land reform with between 1 and 2 million landlords executed. Under its leadership, China developed an independent industrial base and its own nuclear weapons. The Chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million. However, Mao's Great Leap Forward, a large-scale economic and social reform project, resulted in an estimated 45 million deaths between 1958 and 1961, mostly from starvation. In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a period of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China in the United Nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.After Mao's death in 1976 and the arrest of the faction known as the Gang of Four, who were blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping took power and led the country to significant economic reforms. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the communes were disbanded in favor of private land leases. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment. China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982. In 1989, the violent suppression of student protests in Tiananmen Square brought condemnation and sanctions against the Chinese government from various countries.Video AssignmentWatch:USA vs USSR Fight!

However, after World War II, Europeans realized that colonial rule in Africa would have to end. When both Britain and France let go of their colonial empires in the late part of the '50s and '60s, most black African nations gained their independence.In 1957, the Gold Coast, renamed Ghana, under the guidance ofKwame Nkrumah,was the first former British colony to gain independence. Nigeria, the Belgian Congo (now named the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Kenya, and other nations soon followed. Seventeen new African nations would emerge in 1960 alone. Between 1961 and 1965 another 11 nations followed suit. After a series of brutal wars, the Portuguese would finally surrender the colonies of Mozambique and Angola in the 1970s.[Figure 1]Countries of Africa, with date of independenceIn the northern portion of Africa, the French allowed full independence in Morocco and Tunisia in 1956. Because Algeria was home to two million French settlers, France chose to keep control there. In the meantime, Algerian nationalists had organized the National Liberation Front (FLN) and in 1954 initiated a guerrilla war to liberate their homeland. The French leader, Charles e Gaulle, granted Algeria its independence in 1962.The Gold CoastTheGold Coastwas a British colony on the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa that became the independent nation of Ghana in 1957.The first Europeans to arrive at the coast were the Portuguese in 1471. They encountered a variety of African kingdoms, some of which controlled substantial deposits of gold in the soil. In 1482, the Portuguese built the Castle of Elmina, the first European settlement on the Gold Coast. From here they traded slaves, gold, knives, beads, mirrors, rum and guns. News of the successful trading spread quickly, and eventually, British, Dutch, Danish, Prussian and Swedish traders arrived as well. The European traders built several forts along the coastline. TheGold Coasthad long been a name for the region used by Europeans because of the large gold resources found in the area. The slave trade was the principal exchange for many years.The British Gold Coast was formed in 1867 after the British government abolished the African Company of Merchants in 1821 and seized privately held lands along the coast. They also took over the remaining interests of other European countries, purchasing and incorporating the Danish Gold Coast in 1850 and the Dutch Gold Coast, including Fort Elmina, in 1872. Britain steadily expanded its colony through the invasion of local kingdoms as well, particularly the Ashanti and Fante confederacies. The Ashanti people had controlled much of the territory of Ghana before the Europeans arrived and were often in conflict with them. They are the largest ethnic community in Ghana. Four wars, the Anglo-Ashanti Wars, were fought between the Ashanti (Asante) and the British, who were sometimes allied with the Fante.[Figure 2]e Portuguese-built Elmina Castle was purchased by Britain in 1873. Also known as St. George Castle, it is now a World Heritage SiteDuring the First Anglo-Ashanti War (1822–1824), the two groups fought because of a disagreement over an Ashanti chief and slavery. Tensions increased in 1874 during the Second Ashanti War (1873–1874) when the British sacked the Ashanti capital of Kumasi. The Third Ashanti War (1893–1894) occurred because the new Ashanti ruler Asantehene wanted to exercise his new title. From 1895–1896 the British and Ashanti fought in the Fourth and final Ashanti War, where the Ashanti fought for and lost their independence. In 1900 the Ashanti Uprising took place, resulting in the British capture of the city of Kumasi. At the end of this last Ashanti War, the Ashanti people became a British protectorate on 1 January 1902.By 1901, all of the Gold Coast was a British colony, with its kingdoms and tribes considered a single unit. The British exported a variety of natural resources such as gold, metal ores, diamonds, ivory, pepper, timber, grain, and cocoa. The British colonists built railways and the complex transport infrastructure which formed the basis for the transport infrastructure in modern-day Ghana. They also built Western-style hospitals and schools to provide modern amenities to the people of the empire.By 1945, the native population was demanding more autonomy in the wake of the end of the Second World War and the beginnings of the decolonization process across the world. By 1956, British Togoland, the Ashanti protectorate, and the Fante protectorate were merged with the Gold Coast to create one colony, which became known as the Gold Coast. In 1957 the colony gained independence under the name of Ghana.South Africa[Figure 3]""For use by white persons"" apartheid-era sign.In South Africa, where the political system was dominated by European settlers, the process was more complicated. Political activity on the part of local blacks had begun with the formation of the African National Congress (ANC) in 1912. The goal of the group was to achieve both economic and political reform in South Africa. However, their efforts, met with little, if any, success.By the 1950's  South African whites (descended from the Dutch and known as Afrikaners) had strengthened the laws separating whites and blacks. The result was a system of racial segregation known as apartheid (apartness).Blacks demonstrated against the apartheid laws, but the white government brutally suppressed the movement. In 1960 the government fired on people who were leading a peaceful march in Sharpeville, killing 69, two-thirds of whom were shot in the back. Afterward, ANC leader Nelson Mandela was arrested and members of the ANC called for armed resistance against the white government.In the meantime, on 31 May 1961, the country became a republic following a general direct vote in which white voters narrowly voted in favor thereof.  Queen Elizabeth II was stripped of the titleQueen of South Americaand the last Governor-General, Charles Roberts Swart, became State President. As a concession to the Westminister system, the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless.  P. W. Botha's Constitution Act of 1983 eliminated the office of the Prime Minister and instated a near-unique ""strong presidency"" responsible to Parliament.  After being pressured by other Commonwealth of Nations countries, South Africa left the organization in 1961 and was readmitted in 1994.Despite opposition both within and outside the country,the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid.  The security forces harshly oppressed resistance movements and violence became widespread with anti-apartheid activists using strikes, marches, protests, and sabotage by bombing and other means. The African National Congress (ANC) was a major resistance movement.  Apartheid became increasingly controversial and some Western nations and institutions began to boycott business with South Africa due to its racial policies and suppression of civil rights.  International sanctions and divestment of holdings by investors accompanied growing unrest and opposition within South Africa.Nelson MandelaNelson Rolihlahla Mandelawas a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black chief executive, and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalized racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. Internationally, Mandela was Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999.A Xhosa born to the Thembu royal family, Mandela attended Fort Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. Living in Johannesburg, he became involved in anti-colonial politics, joining the ANC and becoming a founding member of its Youth League. After the Afrikaner minority government of the National Party established apartheid in 1948, he rose to prominence in the ANC's 1952 Defiance Campaign, was appointed superintendent of the organization's Transvaal chapter and presided over the 1955 Congress of the People. Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) in 1961, leading a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government. In 1962, he was arrested, convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the state, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.[Figure 4]Nelson Mandela c. 1937Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. An international campaign lobbied for his release, which was granted in 1990 amid escalating civil strife. Mandela joined negotiations with National Party President F. W. de Klerk to abolish apartheid and establish multiracial elections in 1994, in which he led the ANC to victory and became South Africa's first black president. He published his autobiography in 1995. He led South Africa's Government of National Unity and promulgated a new constitution. He also created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. While continuing with the former government's economic liberalism, his administration also introduced measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally he acted as mediator between Libya and the United Kingdom in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, and oversaw military intervention in Lesotho. He declined to run for a second term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman, focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation.Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Denounced as a communist terrorist by critics, he nevertheless gained international acclaim for his activism, having received more than 250 honors, including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Soviet Order of Lenin. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name,Madiba, or asTata(""Father""); he is often described as the ""Father of the Nation"".The Indian Independence MovementThe numbers of British in India were small, yet they were able to rule two-thirds of the subcontinent directly and exercise considerable leverage over the princely states that accounted for the remaining one-third of the area.One of the most effective events of the 19th century was the rise of Indian nationalism.‪It was because of this rising nationalism that Indians first sought ""self-rule"" and later ""complete independence"". However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. The probable reasons include ""clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests"",‪""racial discriminations"",‪""the revelation of India's past"",‪""inter-linking of the new social groups in different regions""‪and Indians coming in close contact with ""European education"".[Figure 5]Flag of the British Raj in India.The first step toward Indian self-rule was the appointment of councilors to advise the British viceroy in 1861 and the first Indian was appointed in 1909. Provincial Councils with Indian members were also set up. The councilors' participation was subsequently widened into legislative councils. The British built a large British Indian Army, with the senior officers all British, and many of the troops from small minority groups such as Gurkhas from Nepal and Sikhs.‪The civil service was increasingly filled with natives at the lower levels, with the British holding the more senior positions.Bal Gangadhar Tilak, an Indian nationalist leader, declared Swaraj as the destiny of the nation. His popular sentence ""Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it""‪became the source of inspiration for Indians. Tilak was backed by rising public leaders like Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, who held the same point of view. Under them, India's three big provinces – Maharashtra, Bengal, and Punjab shaped the demand of the people and India's nationalism. In 1907, the Congress was split into two factions: The radicals, led by Tilak, advocated civil agitation and direct revolution to overthrow the British Empire and the abandonment of all things British. The moderates, led by leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale, on the other hand, wanted reform within the framework of British rule.‪[Figure 6]Former residence of the Commander in Chief of the British Indian Army and later the residence of the first Prime Minister of India, Nehru.The British themselves adopted a ""carrot and stick"" approach in recognition of India's support during the First World War and in response to renewed nationalist demands. The means of achieving the proposed measure were later enshrined in the Government of India Act 1919, which introduced the principle of a dual mode of administration, or diarchy, in which both elected Indian legislators and appointed British officials shared power.From 1920 leaders such asMahatma Gandhibegan highly popular mass movements to campaign against the British Raj using largely peaceful methods. The Gandhi-led independence movement opposed British rule using non-violent methods like non-cooperation, civil disobedience, and economic resistance. However, revolutionary activities against the British rule took place also throughout the Indian sub-continent and some others adopted a militant approach like the Indian National Army that sought to overthrow British rule by armed struggle and. Government of India Act 1935 was a major success in this regard.‪All these movements succeeded in bringing independence to the new dominions of India and Pakistan on 15 August 1947.Mahatma GandhiMohandas Karamchand Gandhi(October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorificMahatma(Sanskrit: ""high-souled"", ""venerable"")—applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa,‪—is now used worldwide. He is also calledBapu(Gujarati: endearment for ""father"",‪""papa""‪) in India.Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organizing peasants, farmers, and urban laborers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achievingSwarajor self-rule.Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and later in calling for the British toQuit Indiain 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India. Gandhi attempted to practice nonviolence and truth in all situations. He advocated that others do the same. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indiandhotiand shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on acharkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and social protest.Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.‪Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire‪was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan.‪As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to promote religious harmony. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 at age 78,‪also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.‪Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating.‪Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest at point-blank range.‪VideoAssignmentWatch:Decolonization and Nationalism Triumphantby Crash Course World HistoryInteractive Notebook AssignmentsReviewQuestionsHow did the end of World War II facilitate the decolonization of India, Indochina, Africa, and Indonesia?What were the characteristics of global independence movements after WWII?What qualities of Indira Gandhi enabled her to dominate Indian politics for three decades?What tactics were used by various groups and individuals to aid them in their resistance to political oppression and desire for social change?VocabularyapartheidA South African policy of complete legal separation of the races, including banning of all social contacts between blacks and whites.Civil disobedienceA deliberate and public refusal to obey a law considered unjust.decolonizationThe process of a country once controlled as a colony by an outside force gaining its independence.

49,10.3,Modern Global Culture,"Student Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this section the student will be able toSummarizethe economic and social impact of the 20th-century globalizationExplainthe role of telecommunication technology, computer technology, transportation technology, and medical advancements in developing the modern global economy and society.Explain the significance of the Leauge of Nations and the United Nations.Asses the degree to which American ideals have advanced human rights throughout the world.Describethe major influences of women such as... Mother Teresa, Margaret Thatcher, and Golda Meir during major eras of world history.GlobalizationGlobalization (or globalisation) is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities.Though scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World. Some even trace the origins to the third millennium BCE. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.The concept of globalization 'emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of ""communities of practice"": academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians. In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: trade and transactions, capital and investment movements, migration and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge. Further, environmental challenges such as global warming, cross-boundary water and air pollution, and over-fishing of the ocean are linked with globalization. Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the natural environment.International BusinessInternational trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories. In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP). Industrialization, advanced transportation, multinational corporations, offshoring and outsourcing all have a major impact on world trade. The growth of international trade is a fundamental component of globalization.An absolute trade advantage exists when countries can produce a commodity with fewer costs per unit produced than could its trading partner. By the same reasoning, it should import commodities in which it has an absolute disadvantage. While there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage, comparative advantage – that is, the ability to offer goods and services at a lower marginal and opportunity cost – extends the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges. In a globalized business environment, companies argue that the comparative advantages offered by international trade have become essential to remaining competitive.[Figure 1]Singapore has embraced globalization in the last few decades.OutsourcingOne result of globalization and international business is something known as outsourcing. In business, outsourcing involves the contracting out of a business process to another party (compare business process outsourcing). The concept ""outsourcing"" came from American Glossary 'outside resourcing' and it dates back to at least 1981. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another, but not always. Outsourcing is also the practice of handing over control of public services to for-profit corporations.Outsourcing can also be viewed as any assistance from an intermediary that is more capable of or familiar with certain practices than us. It is just a way of seeking help.Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes offshoring (relocating a business function to another country). Financial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring.The opposite of outsourcing, insourcing, entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration. However, a business can provide a contract service to another business without necessarily insourcing that business process.Outsourcing is a very important tool for reducing cost and improving quality. If an organization does one or all its work by itself, its work may affect its production quality. So, an organization must recognize some important areas where it can reduce its costs and maintain high quality in its products and/or services.Human RightsAnother issue which has risen to the forefront of social consciousness in the few centuries is the idea of human rights. Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights ""to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,"" and which are ""inherent in all human beings"" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.[Figure 2]The English Bill of Rights.The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law, global and regional institutions. Actions by states and non-governmental organizations form a basis of public policy worldwide. The idea of human rights suggests that ""if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights."" The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable skepticism and debates about the content, nature, and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompass a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, free speech, or a right to education, there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard.Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the atrocities of The Holocaust,[6] culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson, and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui, and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the twentieth century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide, and war crimes, as a realization of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society.“Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world...”—1st sentence of the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.""—Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)Human Rights in the 20th CenturyThe World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern human rights instruments. The League of Nations was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.At the 1945 Yalta Conference, the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the United Nations. The United Nations has played an important role in international human rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organizations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the western and eastern Cold War blocs. Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasized in the latter half of the twentieth century because it ""provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and postcolonialist.""[Figure 3]UN Peacekeepers in the city of Goma.International Protection and Promotion of Human RightsThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of World War II. It is generally viewed as the preeminent statement of international rights and has been identified as being a culmination of centuries of thinking along both secular and religious lines. Although the UDHR is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered by some to have acquired the force of international customary law which may be invoked in appropriate circumstances by national and other tribunals.[citation needed] The UDHR urges member nations to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights as part of the ""foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world."" The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens....recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.—Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt as Chair, who began to discuss an International Bill of Rights in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority. Canadian law professor John Humphrey and French lawyer René Cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. According to Cassin, the final three articles place rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized.Women's RightsWomen's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide. In some places, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include, though are not limited to, the right: to bodily integrity and autonomy; to vote; to hold public office; to work; to birth control; to have an abortion; to be free from rape; to fair wages or equal pay; to own property; to education; to serve in the military or be conscripted; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital or parental rights.Right to VoteDuring the 19th century, some women began to ask for, demand, and then agitate and demonstrate for the right to vote - the right to participate in their government and its lawmaking. Other women opposed suffrage, like Helen Kendrick Johnson, whose prescient 1897 work, Woman and the Republic, contains perhaps the best arguments against women's suffrage of the time. The ideals of women's suffrage developed alongside that of universal suffrage and today women's suffrage is considered a right (under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). During the 19th century, the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.1919 election poster, German social democrats. ""Frauen! Gleiche Rechte, Gleiche Pflichten"" (""Women! The same rights, the same duties"")A number of Nordic countries gave women the right to vote in the early 20th century – Finland (1906), Norway (1913), Denmark and Iceland (1915). With the end of the First World War, many other countries followed – the Netherlands (1917), Austria, Azerbaijan, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Georgia, Poland and Sweden (1918), Germany and Luxembourg (1919), and the United States (1920). Spain gave women the right to vote in 1931, France in 1944, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Yugoslavia in 1946. Switzerland gave women the right to vote in 1971, and Liechtenstein in 1984.In Latin America, some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th century – Ecuador (1929), Brazil (1932), El Salvador (1939), Dominican Republic (1942), Guatemala (1956) and Argentina (1946). In India, under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other Asian countries gave women the right to vote in the mid 20th century – Japan (1945), China (1947) and Indonesia (1955). In Africa, women generally got the right to vote along with men through universal suffrage – Liberia (1947), Uganda (1958) and Nigeria (1960). In many countries in the Middle East universal suffrage was acquired after the Second World War, although in others, such as Kuwait, suffrage is very limited. On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote.Modern Rights MovementIn subsequent decades, women's rights again became an important issue in the English speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called ""feminism"" or ""women's liberation."" Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.The International Council of Women (ICW) was the first women's organization to work across national boundaries for the common cause of advocating human rights for women. In March and April 1888, women leaders came together in Washington D.C. with 80 speakers and 49 delegates representing 53 women's organizations from 9 countries: Canada, the United States, Ireland, India, England, Finland, Denmark, France, and Norway. Women from professional organizations, trade unions, arts groups, and benevolent societies participated. National Councils are affiliated to the ICW and thus make themselves heard at the international level. The ICW worked with the League of Nations during the 1920s and the United Nations post-World War II. Today the ICW holds Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the highest accreditation an NGO can achieve at the United Nations. Currently, it is composed of 70 countries and has a headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. International meetings are held every three years.[Figure 5]Women standing in line to vote in Bangladesh.In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favor of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP Willie Hamilton's select committee report, his equal pay for equal work bill, the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, Lady Sear's draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government Green Paper of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an Equal Opportunities Commission came into force. With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the EEC soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.In the USA, the National Organization for Women (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). This amendment stated that ""equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex."" But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right to be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.Important Women Political/Religious FiguresGolda Meir(May 3, 1898 – December 8, 1978) was an Israeli teacher, kibbutznik, politician and the fourth Prime Minister of Israel.Meir was elected Prime Minister of Israel on March 17, 1969, after serving as Minister of Labour and Foreign Minister. Israel's first woman and the world's fourth woman to hold such an office, she was thought of as the ""Iron Lady"" of Israeli politics years before the epithet was coined for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Former Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion used to call Meir ""the best man in the government""; she was often portrayed as the ""strong-willed, straight-talking, grey-bunned grandmother of the Jewish people"".Meir resigned as prime minister in 1974, the year following the Yom Kippur War. She died in 1978 of lymphoma.[Figure 6]Meir (center) with Pat and Richard Nixon in 1973.Mother TheresaBlessed Teresa of Calcutta, MC, commonly known as Mother Teresa (26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), was a Roman Catholic religious sister and missionary who lived most of her life in India. She was born in what is today Macedonia, with her family being of Albanian descent originating in Kosovo.Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation, which in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters and is active in 133 countries. They run hospices and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis; soup kitchens; dispensaries and mobile clinics; children's and family counseling programs; orphanages; and schools. Members must adhere to the vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience as well as a fourth vow, to give ""wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor"".[Figure 7]More details President Ronald Reagan presents Mother Teresa with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony, 1985Mother Teresa was the recipient of numerous honors including the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2003, she was beatified as ""Blessed Teresa of Calcutta"". A second miracle credited to her intercession is required before she can be recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church.A controversial figure both during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was widely admired by many for her charitable works, but also widely criticized, particularly for her efforts opposing contraception and for substandard conditions in the hospices for which she was responsible.Margaret ThatcherMargaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, PC, FRS (née Roberts, 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013) was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British Prime Minister of the 20th century and is the only woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist called her the ""Iron Lady"", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.[Figure 8]U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher meet at the White House in 1988.Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election.On moving into 10 Downing Street, Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasized deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labor markets, the privatization of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment until the 1982 Falklands War brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her re-election in 1983.Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the ""poll tax"") was widely unpopular and others, in her cabinet, did not share her views on the European Community. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire, which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords.

50,10.4,Arab-Israeli Conflict and Islamic Fundamentalism,"
Palestinian Authority
 
the Palestinian administrative organization established in 1993 under the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It serves as an administrative entity similar to a county or municipal government in charge of public safety, education, utilities, and public health, though it is not permitted to conduct foreign policy. Its jurisdiction is limited to less than 20% of the Palestinian territories under Israeli occupation. The majority of the West Bank remains under direct Israeli control.
 
Gaza Strip
 
a small coastal region bordering Israel and the Mediterranean Sea. Since 1994, it is has been administered by the Palestinian Authority, though both Egypt and Israel have administered it in the past. It continues to be an area of contention between Israelis and the Palestinians.
 
Israel
 
in ancient history, the kingdom of the Hebrews (Jews) in Palestine. It is now the Jewish nation established in 1948 shortly after the Holocaust. Most Palestinians and Arabs continue to reject Jewish control of this territory, for although it was originally a Jewish state 3,000 years in the past, the area had been under Arab Muslim control since the 7th century, and Palestinian (both Muslim and Christian) control since the 2nd century.
 
Oslo Accords
 
signed in 1993, the first direct, face-to-face agreement between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was intended to be a framework for future negotiations and relations between the Israeli government and Palestinians. The Accords provided for the creation of a Palestinian National Authority that would have responsibility for the administration of the territory under its control. The Accords also called for the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
 
Six Day War
 
a six-day war fought in 1967 between Israel and several Arab states, during which Israel took control of Jerusalem, the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, and the West Bank.
 
West Bank
 
a geographic area that shares borders that align with the Jordan River, Israel, and Jordan. Formerly a territory of Palestine, it has been partially under Israeli occupation ever since the Israel Six Day War of 1967, and partially under the government of the Palestinian National Authority. It continues to be an area of contention between Israeli and Palestinian forces.
 
Yom Kippur War
 
a conflict fought in 1973 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. It was launched during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, which happened to occur that year during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The United States and the Soviet Union would initiate massive supply efforts to their respective allies during the war that led to a near-confrontation between the two nuclear, Cold War superpowers. After mutual battlefield victories, the war drew both sides into the Camp David Accords.
 
Palestinians 
 
mostly Arab descendants of the peoples who have lived in Palestine over the centuries. They primarily reside in the Gaza strip, the West Bank and, to a lesser extent, in other areas of Israel. In addition, several waves of exile due to war, internal strife, and persecution have created a “Palestinian diaspora,” whereby approximately half of all Palestinians live outside of their original homeland. Their right to return to Palestine and modern-day Israel remains a key point of contention in world affairs.
 
terrorism
 
The use of threats or force to frighten people or governments to change their behavior or policies.
 
September 11, 2001
 
the date on which al-Qaeda terrorists living in the United States hijacked several U.S. commercial airlines and crashed them into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center in New York City. President George W. Bush would respond by declaring a “War on Terrorism
 
Al-Qaeda
 
a radical Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organization formed in 1988 by Osama Bin Laden. Al-Qaeda established camps in Afghanistan to train its members in guerilla warfare tactics and acts of terrorism. Members of the group carried out the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
 
Ayatollah Khomeini
 
an ayatollah (religious leader) of Iran who returned from exile to establish a Fundamentalist Islamic state in Iran opposed to Western influences. He came to power in 1979 after the U.S. supported Shah, a more secular leader, had been overthrown. Khomeini approved of the taking of American hostages seized in 1979 from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and who were held for 444 days.
 
Osama Bin Laden
 
leader of the Islamic terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda. A wealthy Saudi who fought against the Russians in Afghanistan, he was angered by the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, established Al-Qaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and initiated the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. In 2011, nearly ten years later, U.S. Navy Seals and CIA operatives operating in Pakistan located and killed Bin Laden in a covert operation ordered by the U.S. government
 
Taliban
 
a group of radical Islamic Fundamentalists that gained control of Afghanistan after the Russian withdrawal from that country in 1989. They maintained strict, Islamic control and permitted terrorist groups like al-Qaeda to operate training camps within the country. After the 9-11 attacks, the US. and its allies invaded Afghanistan and overthrew the Taliban regime. However, the Taliban continue to operate there and engage in acts of violence against U.S. forces and those attempting to defend the newly established democratic government there.

When French Indochina was given independence, Cambodia lost hope of regaining control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to Vietnam. Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the area had been controlled by the Vietnamese since 1698, with King Chey Chettha II granting Vietnamese permission to settle in the area decades before.[43] This remains a diplomatic sticking point with over one million ethnic Khmers (the Khmer Krom) still living in this region. The Khmer Rouge attempted invasions to recover the territory which, in part, led to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and deposition of the Khmer Rouge.[Figure 1]Location of Cambodia (green)in ASEAN (dark grey) – [Legend]In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favor of his father in order to participate in politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed. The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968. However, in public Sihanouk refuted the US' right to use air strikes in Cambodia and on 26 March Prince Sihanouk said ""these criminal attacks must immediately and definitively stop..."" and on 28 March a press conference was held and Sihanouk appealed to the international media ""I appeal to you to publicize abroad this very clear stand of Cambodia--that is, I will in any case oppose all bombings on Cambodian territory under whatever pretext."" Nevertheless, the public pleas of Sihanouk were ignored and the bombing continued.[Figure 2]Norodom Sihanouk and Mao Zedong in 1956This public display of a break with the United States would cause members of the government and army to become resentful of Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his foreign policy.Khmer Republic (1970–75)While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak. U.S. support for the coup remains unproven. However, once the coup was completed, the new regime, which immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia, gained the political support of the United States. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of civil war. Soon Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. However, from 1970 until early 1972, the Cambodian conflict was largely one between the government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North Vietnam. As they gained control of Cambodian territory, the Vietnamese communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists we now refer to as the Khmer Rouge.[49] Between 1969 and 1973, Republic of Vietnam and U.S. forces bombed Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer Rouge.Who were the Khmer Rouge? Khmers rouges or, as they are more commonly known in English, ‘Khmer Rouge' was the name given to the followers of the Communist Party of Kampuchea in Cambodia. It was formed in 1968 as an offshoot of the Vietnam People's Army from North Vietnam. It was the ruling party in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, led by Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Son Sen, and Khieu Samphan. Democratic Kampuchea was the name of the state as controlled by the government of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979. It allied with North Vietnam, the Viet Cong, and Pathet Lao during the Vietnam War against the anti-Communist forces.The organization is remembered especially for orchestrating the Cambodian genocide, which resulted from the enforcement of its social engineering policies. Its attempts at agricultural reform led to widespread famine, while its insistence on absolute self-sufficiency, even in the supply of medicine, led to the death of thousands from treatable diseases such as malaria. Arbitrary executions and torture carried out by its cadres against perceived subversive elements, or during purges of its own ranks between 1975 and 1978, are considered to have constituted genocide.The government-in-exile (including the Khmer Rouge) still had a seat in the UN in 1979, but it was later taken away, in 1993, as the monarchy was restored and the country underwent a name change to the Kingdom of Cambodia. A year later thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas surrendered themselves in a government amnesty. In 1996, a new political party, the Democratic National Union Movement, was formed by Ieng Sary, who was granted amnesty for all of his roles as the deputy leader of the Khmer Rouge. The organization (Khmer Rouge) was largely dissolved by the mid-1990s and finally surrendered completely in 1999. In 2014 two Khmer Rouge leaders Nuon Chea and Kheiu Samphan were jailed by a UN-backed court for life, which found them guilty of crimes against humanity and responsible for the deaths of up to 2,000,000 Cambodians (Khmer), nearly a quarter of the country's then population, during the ""Killing Fields"" era between 1975-1979.Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea. NVA units overran many Cambodian army positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication. In response to the North Vietnamese invasion, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see Cambodian Incursion). Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin Sirik Matak, and National Assembly leader In Tam. Lon Nol remained in power in part because neither of the others was prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.The Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and Ieng Sary asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the CPK forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population. The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than 2 million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five  days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.GenocideThe Khmer Rouge regime arrested and eventually executed almost everyone suspected of connections with the former government or with foreign governments, as well as professionals and intellectuals. Ethnic Vietnamese, ethnic Thai, ethnic Chinese, ethnic Cham, Cambodian Christians, and the Buddhist monkhood were the demographic targets of persecution. As a result, Pol Pot has been described as ""a genocidal tyrant."" Martin Shaw described the Cambodian genocide as ""the purest genocide of the Cold War era.""Ben Kiernan estimates that about 1.7 million people were killed. Researcher Craig Etcheson of the Documentation Center of Cambodia suggests that the death toll was between 2 and 2.5 million, with a ""most likely"" figure of 2.2 million. After 5 years of researching some 20,000 grave sites, he concludes that ""these mass graves contain the remains of 1,386,734 victims of execution."" A UN investigation reported 2–3 million dead, while UNICEF estimated 3 million had been killed. Demographic analysis by Patrick Heuveline suggests that between 1.17 and 3.42 million Cambodians were killed, while Marek Sliwinski suggests that 1.8 million is a conservative figure. Even the Khmer Rouge acknowledged that 2 million had been killed—though they attributed those deaths to a subsequent Vietnamese invasion. By late 1979, UN and Red Cross officials were warning that another 2.25 million Cambodians faced death by starvation due to “the near destruction of Cambodian society under the regime of ousted Prime Minister Pol Pot,” who were saved by international aid after the Vietnamese invasion.Cambodia's ethnic minorities constituted 15 percent of the population in pre-Khmer Rouge era. Of the 400,000 Vietnamese who lived in Cambodia before 1975, some 150–300,000 were expelled by the previous Lon Nol regime. When Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge came to power, there remained about 100–250,000 Vietnamese in the country. Almost all of them were repatriated by December 1975.The Chinese community (about 425,000 people in 1975) was reduced to 200,000 during the next four years. In the Khmer Rouge's Standing Committee, four members were of Chinese ancestry, two Vietnamese, and two Khmers. Some observers argue that this mixed composition makes it difficult to argue that there was an intent to kill off minorities. R.J. Rummel, an analyst of political killings, argues that there was clear genocidal intent.[Figure 3]Skulls of Khmer Rouge victimsOne estimate is that out of 40,000 to 60,000 monks, only between 800 and 1,000 survived to carry on their religion. We do know that of 2,680 monks in eight monasteries, a mere seventy were alive as of 1979. As for the Buddhist temples that populated the landscape of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge destroyed 95 percent of them, and turned the remaining few into warehouses or allocated them for some other degrading use. Amazingly, in the very short span of a year or so, the small gang of Khmer Rouge wiped out the center of Cambodian culture, its spiritual incarnation, and its institutions. As part of a planned genocide campaign, the Khmer Rouge sought out and killed other minorities, such as the Moslem Cham. In the district of Kompong Xiem, for example, they demolished five Cham hamlets and reportedly massacred 20,000 that lived there; in the district of Koong Neas only four Cham apparently survived out of some 20,000.The judicial process of the Khmer Rouge regime, for minor or political crimes, began with a warning from the Angkar, the government of Cambodia under the regime. People receiving more than two warnings were sent for ""re-education,"" which meant near-certain death. People were often encouraged to confess to Angkar their ""pre-revolutionary lifestyles and crimes"" (which usually included some kind of free-market activity; having had contact with a foreign source, such as a U.S. missionary, international relief or government agency; or contact with any foreigner or with the outside world at all), being told that Angkar would forgive them and ""wipe the slate clean."" This meant being taken away to a place such as Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek for torture and/or execution.The executed were buried in mass graves. In order to save ammunition, the executions were often carried out using poison, spades or sharpened bamboo sticks. In some cases, the children and infants of adult victims were killed by having their heads bashed against the trunks of Chankiri trees and then were thrown into the pits alongside their parents. The rationale was ""to stop them from growing up and taking revenge for their parents' deaths.""Some victims were required to dig their own graves; their weakness often meant that they were unable to dig very deep. The soldiers who carried out the executions were mostly young men or women from peasant families.Prosecution for Crimes Against HumanityIn 1997 the Cambodian government asked for the UN's assistance in setting up a genocide Tribunal. It took nine years to agree to the shape and structure of the court – a hybrid of Cambodian and international laws – before the judges were sworn in in 2006. The investigating judges were presented with the names of five possible suspects by the prosecution on July 18, 2007. On September 19, 2007 Nuon Chea, second in command of the Khmer Rouge and its most senior surviving member, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. He faced Cambodian and foreign judges at the special genocide tribunal and was convicted on 7 August, 2014 and received a life sentence. On July 26, 2010 Kang Kek Iew (aka Comrade Duch), director of the S-21 prison camp, was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment. His sentence was reduced to 19 years, as he had already spent 11 years in prison. On February 2, 2012, his sentence was extended to life imprisonment by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.[Figure 4]A commemorative stupa filled with the skulls of the victims at the Killing Field of Choeung Ek.Genocide in RwandaBackground to the GenocideRwanda had been a colony of Belgium since the end of World War I (prior to that it had been part of the German colony known as German East Africa), and by the late 1950s decolonization, a movement throughout Africa advocating self-rule for Africans, had arrived in Rwanda. Anti-colonial sentiment rose throughout central Africa, and a socialist platform of African unity and equality for all Africans was promoted.More details Classroom in a German East African school, c. March 1914.Encouraged by the Pan-Africanists, Hutu advocates in the Catholic Church, and by Christian Belgians (who were increasingly influential in the Congo), Hutu resentment of the Tutsi increased. The United Nations mandates, the Tutsi elite class, and the Belgian colonialists added to the growing unrest. Grégoire Kayibanda, the founder of PARMEHUTU, led the Hutu ""emancipation"" movement. In 1957, he wrote the ""Hutu Manifesto"". His party quickly became militarized. In reaction, in 1959 the Tutsi formed the UNAR party, lobbying for immediate independence for Ruanda-Urundi, to be based on the existing Tutsi monarchy. This group also became militarized. Skirmishes began between UNAR and PARMEHUTU groups. In July 1959, when the Tutsi Mwami (King) Mutara III Charles died following a routine vaccination, some Tutsi thought he had been assassinated. His younger half-brother became the next Tutsi monarch, Mwami (King) Kigeli V.In November 1959, Tutsis tried to assassinate Kayibanda. Rumors of the death of Hutu politician Dominique Mbonyumutwa at the hands of Tutsis, who had beaten him, set off a violent retaliation, called the wind of destruction. Hutus killed an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 Tutsi; thousands more, including the Mwami, fled to neighboring Uganda before Belgian commandos arrived to quell the violence. Tutsi leaders accused the Belgians of abetting the Hutus. A UN special commission reported racism reminiscent of ""Nazism"" against the Tutsi minorities, and discriminatory actions by the government and Belgian authorities.The revolution of 1959 marked a major change in political life in Rwanda. Some 150,000 Tutsis were exiled to neighbouring countries. Tutsis who remained in Rwanda were excluded from political power in a state becoming more centralized under Hutu power. Tutsi refugees also fled to the South Kivu province of the Congo, where they were known as Banyamalenge.In 1960, the Belgian government agreed to hold democratic municipal elections in Ruanda-Urundi. The Hutu majority elected Hutu representatives. Such changes ended the Tutsi monarchy, which had existed for centuries. A Belgian effort to create an independent Ruanda-Urundi with Tutsi-Hutu power sharing failed, largely due to escalating violence. At the urging of the UN, the Belgian government divided Ruanda-Urundi into two separate countries, Rwanda and Burundi.IndependenceOn 25 September 1961, a referendum was held to establish whether Rwanda should become a republic or remain a kingdom. Citizens voted overwhelmingly for a republic. After parliamentary elections held on the same day, the first Rwandese Republic was declared, with Kayibanda as prime minister. Mbonyumutwa was named the first president of the transitional government.Between 1961 and 1962, Tutsi guerrilla groups staged attacks into Rwanda from neighboring countries. Rwandan Hutu-based troops responded, and thousands more were killed in the clashes. On 1 July 1962, Belgium, with UN oversight, granted full independence to the two countries. Rwanda was created as a republic governed by the majority MDR-Parmehutu, which had gained full control of national politics. In 1963, a Tutsi guerrilla invasion into Rwanda from Burundi unleashed another anti-Tutsi backlash by the Hutu government; their forces killed an estimated 14,000 people. The economic union between Rwanda and Burundi was dissolved and tensions between the two countries worsened. Rwanda became a Hutu-dominated one-party state. In excess of 70,000 people had been killed.[citation needed]Kayibanda became Rwanda's first elected president, leading a government chosen from the membership of the directly elected unicameral National Assembly. Peaceful negotiation of international problems, social and economic elevation of the masses, and integrated development of Rwanda were the ideals of the Kayibanda regime. He established formal relations with 43 countries, including the United States, in the first ten years. Despite the progress made, inefficiency and corruption developed in government ministries in the mid-1960s.The Kayibanda administration established quotas to try to increase the number of Hutu in schools and the civil service. This effort ended up penalizing the Tutsi. They were allowed only nine percent of secondary school and university seats, which was their proportion of the population. The quotas also extended to the civil service. With unemployment high, competition for such opportunities increased ethnic tensions. The Kayibanda government also continued the Belgian colonial government's policy of requiring ethnic identity cards, and it discouraged ""mixed"" marriages.Following more violence in 1964, the government suppressed political opposition. It banned the political parties UNAR and RADER and executed Tutsi members. Hutu militants used the term inyenzi (cockroaches) as a pejorative to describe Tutsi rebels for what was perceived as infiltrating the country. Hundreds of thousands of refugees moved to neighbouring countries.The Catholic Church was closely involved with Parmehutu, and they shared local resources and networks. Through the church, the government maintained links with supporters in Belgium and Germany. The country's two newspapers supported the government and were Catholic publications.Military RuleOn July 5, 1973, Defence Minister Maj. Gen. Juvénal Habyarimana overthrew Kayibanda. He suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly and imposed a strict ban on all political activity.Initially, Habyarimana abolished the quota system, winning him favour among Tutsi. However, this didn't last. In 1974, a public outcry developed over Tutsi over-representation in professional fields such as medicine and education. Thousands of Tutsi were forced to resign from such positions, and many were forced into exile. In associated violence, several hundred Tutsi were killed. Gradually, Habyarimana reimposed many of his predecessor's policies favouring Hutu over Tutsi.In 1975, President Habyarimana formed the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) whose goals were to promote peace, unity, and national development. The movement was organized from the ""hillside"" to the national level and included elected and appointed officials.Under MRND aegis, a new constitution making the party a one-party state under the MRND was approved in a referendum in December 1978. These were shortly followed by presidential elections a few weeks later. Habyarimana, as president of the MRND, was the only candidate on the ballot. He was re-elected in 1983 and again in 1988, each time as sole candidate. However, in a minor concession to democracy, voters were given a choice of two MRND candidates in elections to the National Assembly. Responding to public pressure for political reform, President Habyarimana announced in July 1990 his intention to transform Rwanda's one-party state into a multi-party democracy.Civil WarMany exiled refugee Rwandan Tutsis in Uganda had joined the rebel forces of Yoweri Museveni in the Ugandan Bush War and had then become part of the Ugandan military upon the rebel victory in 1986. Among these were Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, who rose to prominence in the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Rwandan rebel group largely consisting of Tutsi veterans of the Ugandan war. On October 1, 1990, the RPF invaded Rwanda from their base in neighboring Uganda. The rebel force, composed primarily of ethnic Tutsis, blamed the government for failing to democratize and resolve the problems of some 500,000 Tutsi refugees living in diaspora around the world.[Figure 6]The Virunga Mountains, the RPF base from 1990–1991The Tutsi diaspora miscalculated the reaction of its invasion of Rwanda. Though the Tutsi objective seemed to be to pressure the Rwandan government into making concessions, the invasion was seen as an attempt to bring the Tutsi ethnic group back into power. The effect was to increase ethnic tensions to a level higher than they had ever been. Nevertheless, after 3 years of fighting and multiple prior ""cease-fires,"" the government and the RPF signed a ""final"" cease-fire agreement in August 1993, known as the Arusha Accords, in order to form a power-sharing government, a plan which immediately ran into problems.The situation worsened when the first elected Burundian president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by the Burundian Tutsi-dominated army in October 1993. In Burundi, a fierce civil war then erupted between Tutsi and Hutu following the army's massacre. This conflict spilled over the border into Rwanda and destabilized the fragile Rwandan accords. Tutsi-Hutu tensions rapidly intensified. Although the UN sent a peacekeeping force named the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), it was underfunded, under-staffed, and largely ineffective in the face of a two-country civil-war. The UN denied Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire's request for additional troops and changes to the rules of engagement to prevent the coming genocide.The Rwandan GenocideOn April 6, 1994, the airplane carrying Juvénal Habyarimana, the President of Rwanda, and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Hutu President of Burundi, was shot down as it prepared to land at Kigali. Both presidents were killed when the plane crashed.Military and militia groups began rounding up and killing Tutsis en masse, as well as political moderates irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. The killing swiftly spread from Kigali to all corners of the country; between April 6 and the beginning of July, a genocide of unprecedented swiftness left between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsis (800,000 is a commonly noted number) and moderate Hutus dead at the hands of organized bands of militia (Interahamwe). Local officials, in order to kill their neighboring Tutsis who were called Inkotanyi - Cockroaches by the local radio stations inciting fear and hatred, called on even ordinary citizens. The president's MRND Party was implicated in organizing many aspects of the genocide. The Hutu genocidaires were abetted by the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcasting hate speech advocating violence against Tutsis. It broadcast at the same time as Radio Muhabura broadcast from Uganda, sponsored by the RPF and their Ugandan allies.The RPF renewed its civil war against the Rwanda Hutu government when it received word that the genocidal massacres had begun. Its leader Paul Kagame directed RPF forces in neighboring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania to invade the country, but here, Paul Kagame did not direct RPF Forces from neighboring countries because RPF was already in Rwanda for three years and a half battling the Hutu forces and Interahamwe militias who were committing the massacres. The resulting civil war raged concurrently with the genocide for two months. The Tutsi-led RPF continued to advance on the capital, and soon occupied the northern, eastern, and southern parts of the country by June. Thousands of additional civilians were killed in the conflict. UN member states refused to answer UNAMIR's requests for increased troops and money. France, in Operation Turquoise, occupied the remaining part of the country not under RPF control. While the French operation did prevent mass killings it has been alleged that the deployment of French troops was intended to allow the Hutu militias to escape and that the slaughter of Tutsis continued in the French controlled area.Aftermath and PeaceBetween July and August 1994, Kagame's Tutsi-led RPF troops first entered Kigali and soon thereafter captured the rest of the country. The Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the genocide, but approximately two million Hutu refugees - some who participated in the genocide and fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. This exodus became known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis.After the Tutsi RPF took control of the government, in 1994, Kagame formed a government of national unity headed by a Hutu president, Pasteur Bizimungu. Kagame became Minister of Defence and Vice-President and was the de facto leader of the country.Following an uprising by the ethnic Tutsi, sometimes referred to as a whole as Banyamulenge (although this term only represents people from one area in eastern Zaire—other ethnic Tutsi Kinyarwanda-speaking people include the Banyamasisi and the Banyarutshuru, as an example) people in eastern Zaire in October 1997, a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to Rwanda in the last two weeks of November. This massive repatriation was followed at the end of December 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from Tanzania, again in a huge, spontaneous wave. Less than 100,000 Rwandans are estimated to remain outside of Rwanda, and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government, its allies in the civilian militias known as Interahamwe, and soldiers recruited in the refugee camps before 1996. There are also many innocent Hutu who remain in the forests of eastern Congo, particularly Rutshuru, Masisi and Bukavu, who have been misinformed by rebel forces that they will be killed upon return to Rwanda. Rebels also use force to prevent these people from returning, as they serve as a human shield.In northwest Rwanda, Hutu militia members killed three Spanish aid workers, three soldiers and seriously wounded one other on January 18, 1997. Since then, most of the refugees have returned and the country is secure for tourists.Rwandan coffee began to gain importance after international taste tests pronounced it among the best in the world, and the U.S. responded with a contribution of 8 million dollars. Rwanda now earns some revenue from coffee and tea export, although it has been difficult to compete with larger coffee-producing countries. The main source of revenue, however, is tourism, mainly mountain gorilla visitation. Their other parks, Nyungwe Forest (one of the last high-altitude tropical forests in the world) and Akagera National Park (a safari game park) have also become popular on the tourism circuit. The lakeside resorts of Gisenyi and Kibuye are also gaining ground.When Bizimungu became critical of the Kagame government in 2000, he was removed as president and Kagame took over the presidency himself. Bizimungu immediately founded an opposition party (the PDR), but the Kagame government banned it. Bizimungu was arrested in 2002 for treason, sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released by a presidential pardon in 2007.The postwar government has placed a high priority on development, opening water taps in the most remote areas, providing free and compulsory education, and promulgating progressive environmental policies. Their Vision 2020 development policy has the aim of achieving a service-based society by 2020, with a significant middle class. There is remarkably little corruption in the country.Hutu Rwandan genocidal leaders are on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in the Rwandan National Court system, and, most recently, through the informal Gacaca program. Recent reports highlight a number of reprisal killings of survivors for giving evidence at Gacaca. These Gacaca trials are overseen by the government established the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. Gacaca is a traditional adjudication mechanism at the umudugudu (village) level, whereby members of the community elect elders to serve as judges, and the entire community is present for the case. This system was modified to try lower-level génocidaires, those who had killed or stolen but did not organize massacres. Prisoners, dressed in pink, stand trial before members of their community. Judges accord sentences, which vary widely, from returning to prison, to paying back the cost of goods stolen, to working in the fields of families of victims. Gacaca is expected to conclude in December 2008. For many, Gacaca has been a vehicle for closure, and prisoners' testimonies have helped many families locate victims. Gacaca takes place once a week in the morning in every village across Rwanda and is compulsory.Ethnicity has been formally outlawed in Rwanda, in the effort to promote a culture of healing and unity. One can stand trial for discussion of the different ethnic groups.Rwanda has become a President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) focus country, and the United States has been providing AIDS programming, education, training, and treatment. Rwandans who have been infected can now receive free antiretroviral drugs in health centers across the country, as well as food packages.Video AssignmentPart 1Part 21.
